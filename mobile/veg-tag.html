In Kolkata I never eat 'phuchka' with sweet chutney, always with tangy tamarind water ? and believe me there is no fun of having them sweet, the taste has to be spicy and tangy. 'Phuchka' is nothing but hollow chips with spicy potato mixture in the center and then filled with tangy water. So, so, so good and tastes million bucks ! Every single description will be short in comparison to a plate of 'phuchka'. As I used store bought chips, so, I am sharing only the recipe of potato filling and tangy water.
