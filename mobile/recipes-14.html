In restaurants the actual tandoor flavour comes when juices of chicken drops on the charcoal, it creats a nice smokey flavour. You will fall in love with this dish.

Last wednesday we both wanted to eat veg in dinner and I had an eggplant(begun) in my fridge. So, I googled for some spicy veg recipes made with eggplant, and my eyes got stuck to this one. The recipe is simple and very easy to make. I just made a little change, as 'he' doesn't like tamarind (tetul/imli) in his food, I had to use yogurt instead of it.

There is nothing but 'super tasty' I can say about her chola. I have already posted that recipe. Last night I made bhaturas with niramish aloo torkari or spicy potato curry.

There is no question about that combo, it tastes heavenly. This dish is no onion and no garlic recipe but the attraction is its nice red color. You will need different types of spice powder for this recipe. I don't know much about kashmiri cuisin, this was my first try and I just nailed it ? .

The most simple and easy one is 'macher jhol' or fish curry. 'Jhol' means runny version of a curry. This dish is usually served as lunch with steamed rice and we all are fan of it. In 'macher jhol' you can use rohu / katla / tilapia / pomfret / pabda etc. One can add many kinds of vegetables like potato, cauliflower, eggplant, green peas, carrot etc. I always make this dish with potato and cauliflower because of 'him'?. He typically loves this combo. According to me, there is only one restriction about this dish. You have to use 'green chilies' only for the heat and flavour.
