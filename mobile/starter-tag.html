So, I had exactly 1 hour in my hand to make something. Don't know why, but suddenly a thought of spending evening time in India, came in my mind. My grandpa used to bring different kinds of snacks like 'samosa', 'nimki', 'vegetable chop', 'kachori', 'beguni' etc and with all our family members we enjoyed those with a cup of tea and some puffed rice (muri). Those are kind of evenings, which I will miss rest of my life. After so many thoughts, I planned to make 'matar kachori' / peas kachori because I had some frozen peas in my kitchen. The recipe is very easy, simple and tasty. All of my 'kachori'-s came out perfectly and his expression was like ???. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a lovely evening with your loved ones.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR vegItem-1"></tr><tr class="nonVegItem-1"><td><div style='clear:both;width:100%'><div class='leftitem' style=""><a href='chingrir-chop.html'><img title='Chingrir Chop / Shrimp Croquettes' alt='Chingrir Chop / Shrimp Croquettes' src="../recipeimages/chingrir-chop.jpg?sessionId=306"/></a></div><div class="rightitem"><div class="title"><div><a alt="Chingrir Chop / Shrimp Croquettes" title="Chingrir Chop / Shrimp Croquettes" class='noStyle' href="chingrir-chop.html">Chingrir Chop / Shrimp Croquettes</a>&nbsp;(NonVeg Item)</div></div><div class="desc">This snack is a very popular street food in West Bengal. You will enjoy these croquettes more from small street food shop / gumti / jhupri , though I don't have any experience of eating 'chingrir chop' from any restaurant. In US, there is no 'gumti', thats why I had to make those in my kitchen and brought the exact taste from Bengal. They were really delicious and we enjoyed them with chilli sauce, but you can also serve them with 'kasundi'. There are many ways of making these croquettes, here is how I made them.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR nonVegItem-1"></tr><tr class="nonVegItem-1"><td><div style='clear:both;width:100%'><div class='leftitem' style=""><a href='chicken-soup.html'><img title='Chicken Soup (Desi Style)' alt='Chicken Soup (Desi Style)' src="../recipeimages/chicken-soup.jpg?sessionId=306"/></a></div><div class="rightitem"><div class="title"><div><a alt="Chicken Soup (Desi Style)" title="Chicken Soup (Desi Style)" class='noStyle' href="chicken-soup.html">Chicken Soup (Desi Style)</a>&nbsp;(NonVeg Item)</div></div><div class="desc">You know winter is coming and all you need is a bowl of warm soup.

Its very popular in India and nowadays all over the world. There was a rumor that without "tandoor/oven" you cannot make tandoori. But believe me today I am sharing "oven method and gas method" of making tandoori chicken. 'Tandoor' means oven made with clay and the heat comes from charcoal. In restaurants the actual tandoor flavour comes when juices of chicken drops on the charcoal, it creats a nice smokey flavour. You will fall in love with this dish.
