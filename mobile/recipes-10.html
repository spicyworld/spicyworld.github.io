One of our favourite egg curry is 'sorshe dim posto'- traditional bengali dish. 'Sorshe' means mustard seeds and 'posto' means poppy seeds. Lunch dishes always plays a big part in Bengali cuisine. There are several typically bengali dishes which you can only enjoy as lunch with steamed rice and may be after that, a long nap. This dish is one of those typical dishes but with a very simple and easy recipe. The fresh flavour of green chilies and poppy seeds always makes us happy. It is my pleasure to share this traditional egg recipe with you guys.

I also mentioned it as 'sish kebab' because in several places I found the same recipe but with this name. Serve them always with mint sauce or tzatziki sauce.

Tagore's family is popular for many things and one of them is 'cooking'. Nowadays, you can watch plenty of cooking programmes in TV, but when I was in school, only few magazines used to publish cooking recipes on weekends only. The craze was also different in that time. I still can remember how my mom and grandma used to eagerly waited for these kind of magazine recipes. Among them, one of the popular item was 'Thakurbarir Kosha Mangsho', secret recipe of their family. I am not telling you that there is a huge difference between normal mutton kosha and this one, they also told the usual process but with some slight twists. These twists will make the dish more unique and delicious.

You can make so many items with these tiny green balls like, 'matar paneer', 'peas kachori', 'dum aloo with peas', 'khichdi', 'veg daal', 'cabbage curry with peas' etc. But 'fish curry with green peas paste' may seems new to somebody. Its nothing but a dry fish curry with a tasty extra addition of green peas paste - as simple as that. When I was in school, on 1 of my birthday, mom made this special fish curry for me. That was the first and also last time I ate this dish, but still can remember the unique taste. So, two days before I thought to make something new with fish, suddenly remembered about this one. Immediately I gave a call to mom and asked for the recipe. She told me, I followed every line of her and Taaddaaa... a spicy+sweet+tangy fish curry came out from my kitchen.

But we also love to eat home cooked vegetarian meals. In one of our trip to Digha before marriage, we made a stop at the famous 'Sher-e-punjab' for heavy breakfast. We ate there several times before but never did breakfast, so, that was our first time. As it was morning, we orderd veg like 'aloo paratha', 'aloo gobi', 'roti', 'bhindi masala' and 'lassi'. All of them were delicious but I will never forget the taste of 'aloo gobi'. Oh my god, my mouth is full of water right now !! It was the tasty, spicy and chatpata veg curry I have ever had. Bengalis usually make 'aloo-fulkopi' as a thick runny curry but that was a dry curry and goes best with roti and some salads. You can also give this yummy curry in lunchbox with bread.

We often go there for shopping. A food truck 'Kebabeque' was a new edition to the food court. They served middle eastern food like 'falafel rice', 'hummus', 'shawarma platter' etc. We took a rice bowl with falafel. They served a good amount of flavourful saffron rice, fresh spinach, some good falafel, tasty hummus and tzatziki sauce. We really loved everything in that bowl. But the sauce caught my main attention. It was so fresh, the flavours were unique and added a different taste to the whole bowl. So, after coming home, I started to do research about this 'tzatziki' sauce and I never thought that the ingredients will be so simple. I made this sauce next day with some turkish kebabs and we enjoyed every bite of them.

Today I am sharing the delicious recipe of 'mix Hakka noodles'. The dish has lots of vegetables, chicken and also egg, that's why the name is 'mix chowmin'.

The taste was different from my mom's porota. This was the second story. The last one is from my dearest friend Monica. When I was in Jersy, one of my punjabi friend Monica, was an expert in making 'aloo ka paratha'. She literally taught me how to make them. Her paratha tastes heavenly. So, these paratha stories are parts of my life. As my husband doesn't like wheat paratha / atta paratha, I had to make them with flour / maida.
