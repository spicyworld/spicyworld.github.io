I researched a lot upon new ideas of biriyani, then my eyes got stuck on Chef Sanjay Thumma's 'ulta biriyani'- how beautiful it is!! I won't say that this is the authentic Arabian 'Maqlooba' because their cooking process and recipe are slightly different than ours. Anyway, I was searching for some new ideas and then found one. I was also impressed by its recipe, it's a one pot biriyani. You don't have to spend half of your day in kitchen making biriyani, the dish will take just an hour.

There are several typically bengali dishes which you can only enjoy as lunch with steamed rice and may be after that, a long nap. This dish is one of those typical dishes but with a very simple and easy recipe. The fresh flavour of green chilies and poppy seeds always makes us happy.

I still can remember how my mom and grandma used to eagerly waited for these kind of magazine recipes. Among them, one of the popular item was 'Thakurbarir Kosha Mangsho', secret recipe of their family. I am not telling you that there is a huge difference between normal mutton kosha and this one, they also told the usual process but with some slight twists.

Its nothing but a dry fish curry with a tasty extra addition of green peas paste - as simple as that. When I was in school, on 1 of my birthday, mom made this special fish curry for me. That was the first and also last time I ate this dish, but still can remember the unique taste. So, two days before I thought to make something new with fish, suddenly remembered about this one.

They served a good amount of flavourful saffron rice, fresh spinach, some good falafel, tasty hummus and tzatziki sauce. We really loved everything in that bowl.

Today I am sharing the delicious recipe of 'mix Hakka noodles'. The dish has lots of vegetables, chicken and also egg, that's why the name is 'mix chowmin'. You can also add your choice of protiens like shrimp, tofu, pork, beef etc. This recipe is very simple and easy. You have to try this in your kitchen.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR nonVegItem-1"></tr></table></div><br/><div class='topPaginationData'><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 1' href='recipes.html'>1</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 2' href='recipes-1.html'>2</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 3' href='recipes-2.html'>3</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 4' href='recipes-3.html'>4</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 5' href='recipes-4.html'>5</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 6' href='recipes-5.html'>6</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 7' href='recipes-6.html'>7</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 8' href='recipes-7.html'>8</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 9' href='recipes-8.html'>9</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 10' href='recipes-9.html'>10</a></span><span class="selected">11</span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 12' href='recipes-11.html'>12</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 13' href='recipes-12.html'>13</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 14' href='recipes-13.html'>14</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 15' href='recipes-14.html'>15</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 16' href='recipes-15.html'>16</a></span><span><a title='My Recipes - Page 17' href='recipes-16.html'>17</a></span></div><div class='clear'>&nbsp;</div>
