In childhood I went there with my family on vacation, though I remember nothing much except our album photos. Rajasthan is the land of kings and 'laal maas', which is hot and spicy red colored mutton curry, is their well known dish. The dish is everything about color and flavors. They cook the mutton in a yogurt and onion based sauce with lots of chilies and garlicky flavor. The authentic Laal Maas recipe calls for 'mathania chilli' because they creat very nice red color with much less heat in gravy. Well, many of us don't have access to those chilies, so feel free to use kashmiri red chilies.
