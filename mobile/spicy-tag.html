If you can follow these few simple things, then trust me you can achieve the exact taste of Dhaba style Paneer Masala.

I still can remember how my mom and grandma used to eagerly waited for these kind of magazine recipes. Among them, one of the popular item was 'Thakurbarir Kosha Mangsho', secret recipe of their family. I am not telling you that there is a huge difference between normal mutton kosha and this one, they also told the usual process but with some slight twists.

But we also love to eat home cooked vegetarian meals. In one of our trip to Digha before marriage, we made a stop at the famous 'Sher-e-punjab' for heavy breakfast. We ate there several times before but never did breakfast, so, that was our first time. As it was morning, we orderd veg like 'aloo paratha', 'aloo gobi', 'roti', 'bhindi masala' and 'lassi'. All of them were delicious but I will never forget the taste of 'aloo gobi'. Oh my god, my mouth is full of water right now !! It was the tasty, spicy and chatpata veg curry I have ever had. Bengalis usually make 'aloo-fulkopi' as a thick runny curry but that was a dry curry and goes best with roti and some salads. You can also give this yummy curry in lunchbox with bread.
