With tortilla you can make 'taco', 'burrito', 'quesedilla', 'enchilada' etc. I really love each of them and that's why I want to make tortilla in my own kitchen. Usually they use vegetable lard for the dough, as I didn't have that in my home, I used lots of vegetable oil. You can use olive oil also.

Being a bengali I always face a common question- 'fish and posto(poppy seeds) are your soul food, right?'. And my answer is always 'oh, hell yaa' ... ? Today I will talk about vegetarian food. We always make 'biulir daal' / 'urad daal' with posto. The combo is nothing but heavenly. There is a must ingredient we use in our urad daal is 'hing' / asafoetida. Many bengalis also enjoy this meal with fried eggplant / begunvaja. The recipe is very simple and easy. It is a no onion and no garlic dish.

I guess, this happens to many of you also ?. I always try to do something new to my mutton curry, because you all know about my experimental nature!! This time I made 'khara masala mutton', the taste was heavenly. After finishing the meal, there were nothing but bones in our plate. 'Khara masala' / 'kata moshla' means whole spices. You don't need to add any ground spices / paste in this curry. I think, this is an Eid special dish in Bangladesh. Always serve this mutton curry with plain rice, in that way you can purely enjoy the juicy mutton pieces with its aromatic gravy.

But luckily 'net kabab' brought a big smile on his face and that was my real satisfaction. 'Jali' means net and they have net like texture. You can make this with mutton / beef / chicken.

My grandpa used to bring different kinds of snacks like 'samosa', 'nimki', 'vegetable chop', 'kachori', 'beguni' etc and with all our family members we enjoyed those with a cup of tea and some puffed rice (muri). Those are kind of evenings, which I will miss rest of my life. After so many thoughts, I planned to make 'matar kachori' / peas kachori because I had some frozen peas in my kitchen.
