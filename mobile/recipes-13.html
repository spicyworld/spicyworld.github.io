But we also love to eat home cooked vegetarian meals. In one of our trip to Digha before marriage, we made a stop at the famous 'Sher-e-punjab' for heavy breakfast. We ate there several times before but never did breakfast, so, that was our first time. As it was morning, we orderd veg like 'aloo paratha', 'aloo gobi', 'roti', 'bhindi masala' and 'lassi'. All of them were delicious but I will never forget the taste of 'aloo gobi'. Oh my god, my mouth is full of water right now !! It was the tasty, spicy and chatpata veg curry I have ever had. Bengalis usually make 'aloo-fulkopi' as a thick runny curry but that was a dry curry and goes best with roti and some salads. You can also give this yummy curry in lunchbox with bread. Try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turns out.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR vegItem-1"></tr><tr class="vegItem-1"><td><div style='clear:both;width:100%'><div class='leftitem' style=""><a href='tzatziki-sauce.html'><img title='Tzatziki Sauce' alt='Tzatziki Sauce' src="../recipeimages/tzatziki-sauce.jpg?sessionId=307"/></a></div><div class="rightitem"><div class="title"><div><a alt="Tzatziki Sauce" title="Tzatziki Sauce" class='noStyle' href="tzatziki-sauce.html">Tzatziki Sauce</a>&nbsp;(Veg Item)</div></div><div class="desc">Last month we, two, went for shopping at our nearest outlet mall. We often go there for shopping. A food truck 'Kebabeque' was a new edition to the food court. They served middle eastern food like 'falafel rice', 'hummus', 'shawarma platter' etc. We took a rice bowl with falafel. They served a good amount of flavourful saffron rice, fresh spinach, some good falafel, tasty hummus and tzatziki sauce. We really loved everything in that bowl. But the sauce caught my main attention. It was so fresh, the flavours were unique and added a different taste to the whole bowl. So, after coming home, I started to do research about this 'tzatziki' sauce and I never thought that the ingredients will be so simple. I made this sauce next day with some turkish kebabs and we enjoyed every bite of them.

Today I am sharing the delicious recipe of 'mix Hakka noodles'. The dish has lots of vegetables, chicken and also egg, that's why the name is 'mix chowmin'.

As the picture didn't provide the detailed recipe, except ginger and green chilies, I followed my own instinct while making the curry. After finishing, I got a thin, flavorful, tasty gravy and soft, succulent mutton pieces. The fresh flavour of green chilies makes the curry more scrumptious.

Because it has to be tasty. There are so many colorful vegetables available in grocery market during winter. I told you before that my love for winter is only because of food. We can make and also consume without any tension various types of food. Today I am talking about 'eggplant'. Though we both are not big fan of eggplant, but love it in 2/3 forms- 'begun vaja', 'begun pora' and 'begun vorta'. Yess, the recipe is about the last one. 'Baingan bharta' is a very popular dhaba food in India. A simple veggie with loads of flavour will make your dinner a special one. If you can make this bharta properly, the taste will beat any nonveg dish.

When I was in college, we (my family) loved to eat 'dhaba food' during travel. In India, each and every dhaba serve 'aloo ka paratha'. I tasted their paratha many times and they were delicious. The taste was different from my mom's porota. This was the second story. The last one is from my dearest friend Monica. When I was in Jersy, one of my punjabi friend Monica, was an expert in making 'aloo ka paratha'. She literally taught me how to make them. Her paratha tastes heavenly. So, these paratha stories are parts of my life. As my husband doesn't like wheat paratha / atta paratha, I had to make them with flour / maida.

The authentic recipe is very simple and easy but main trick here is the cooking time. The more you cook, the more texture and taste you will get.

You can see this is a double colored chicken curry. I also maintain two different taste with the color. I know you are thinking that the process will be lenthy, believe me its not. The taste is phenomenal and goes very well with rice. You can also serve this with naan, paratha or roti. Try this in your kitchen and make your meal a colourful one.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR nonVegItem-1"></tr></table></div><br/><div class='topPaginationData'><span><a class="recipes-pagination-prev" title="My Recipes - Page 12" href='recipes-12.html'>&lt;</a></span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 1" href='recipes.html'>1</a></span><span>...</span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 13" href='recipes-12.html'>13</a></span><span class="selected">14</span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 15" href='recipes-14.html'>15</a></span><span>...</span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 18" href='recipes-17.html'>18</a></span><span><a class="recipes-pagination-next" title="My Recipes - Page 14" href='recipes-14.html'>&gt;</a></span></div><div class='clear'>&nbsp;</div>
