Once I ate this curry in my aunt's house and I can still remember the taste. The curry has juicy mutton, spicy gravy, flavorful potato and egg .. do you want anything more ?? It goes very well with plain basmati rice. 'Mutton Dakbangla' will be a great hit for Christmas dinner also. Try this in your kitchen and make your meal a special one.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR nonVegItem-1"></tr><tr class="nonVegItem-1"><td><div style='clear:both;width:100%'><div class='leftitem' style=""><a href='mutton-biriyani.html'><img title='Mutton Biriyani' alt='Mutton Biriyani' src="../recipeimages/mutton-biriyani.jpg?sessionId=306"/></a></div><div class="rightitem"><div class="title"><div><a alt="Mutton Biriyani" title="Mutton Biriyani" class='noStyle' href="mutton-biriyani.html">Mutton Biriyani</a>&nbsp;(NonVeg Item)</div></div><div class="desc">You always have a grand feeling whenever you prnounce the name 'mutton biriyani'. I mean really I need to describe this? It become the most popular indian dish among the world. Biriyani has its own aroma, juicy meat and long grain flavourful rice. But in Kolkata they add boiled potato and egg in their biriyani which makes you more greedy:-) I know that the process is lenthy but believe me you will fall in love with the end result.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR nonVegItem-1"></tr><tr class="nonVegItem-1"><td><div style='clear:both;width:100%'><div class='leftitem' style=""><a href='chicken-korma.html'><img title='Chicken Korma' alt='Chicken Korma' src="../recipeimages/chicken-korma.jpg?sessionId=306"/></a></div><div class="rightitem"><div class="title"><div><a alt="Chicken Korma" title="Chicken Korma" class='noStyle' href="chicken-korma.html">Chicken Korma</a>&nbsp;(NonVeg Item)</div></div><div class="desc">When an inch of oil or ghee floats upon gravy, yes its 'mughlai nawabi dish'. 'Nawab' means king. This category of curries have nice colored, rich, thick, creamy gravy. 'Chicken Korma' is my favourite one. You can easily eat this curry once in a month along with 'biriyani', 'pulaao', 'butter naan' or 'rumali roti'. Do not put this kind of food in your regular diet because you have to make or eat korma without any guilt, otherwise you will never enjoy the richness of mughlai food.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR nonVegItem-1"></tr><tr class="nonVegItem-1"><td><div style='clear:both;width:100%'><div class='leftitem' style=""><a href='fish-muro-muger-daal.html'><img title='Macher Muro die Muger Daal (Fish head cooked with spicy lentil soup)' alt='Macher Muro die Muger Daal (Fish head cooked with spicy lentil soup)' src="../recipeimages/fish-muro-muger-daal.jpg?sessionId=306"/></a></div><div class="rightitem"><div class="title"><div><a alt="Macher Muro die Muger Daal (Fish head cooked with spicy lentil soup)" title="Macher Muro die Muger Daal (Fish head cooked with spicy lentil soup)" class='noStyle' href="fish-muro-muger-daal.html">Macher Muro die Muger Daal (Fish head cooked with spicy lentil soup)</a>&nbsp;(NonVeg Item)</div></div><div class="desc">This lentil soup is one of the traditional food in Bengal. Last weekend I had two fish heads in my fridge. I am personally not too much fond of plain fish head curry. So, I made this dish and it came out really perfect like 'biyebari'. In most of the bengali wedding this dish is must for lunch and everybody loves it. I ate the home made version of this daal twice from my mom. Those times I really didn't find difference because she made it so tasty and this time 'he' didn't find any difference ?. Lets see how I made this 'daal' and don't forget to try it in your kitchen.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR nonVegItem-1"></tr></table></div>
