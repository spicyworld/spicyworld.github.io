Every place has their own style of dhaba / road side food joints. Whenever we plan any short trip within Bengal, we try to make the lunch stop at some popular Dhaba. Their 'torka-ruti' and 'chicken curry' with rice are must for us. I like their chicken curry on little bit of thicker side, whereas the thin curry also tastes awesome.

Though today I am not sharing any Bengali chaat, but 'pav bhaji' is quite famous in Mumbai and many other parts of India. 'Bhaji' indicates spicy, tangy mashed vegetable curry and 'pav' means bread / bun. After having a plate of 'pav bhaji', don't ever forget to have a cup of milky tea ... trust me on this one.

Today's recipe is about 'paneer rezala', a vegetarian mughlai delicacy, where paneer cubes are cooked in a nut based white gravy and in that my very own addition is some fried capsicum.

Now you guys know why there is no step by step pictures in this recipe. Anyway, among all of this depression, the brightest side is the dish 'mangsher chop'. In Bengal, it is one of the popular and lip smacking snack which you can get in many fast food centers. Spicy, crumbly mutton filling inside and crispy coating outside. Here in Austin, it was pouring heavily from last 2 - 3 days and I couldn't find any better day than this to make those croquettes.
