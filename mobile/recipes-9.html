Presently we are staying at Austin and our last trip was to California on June, 2015. You can think of how much bore we were for not going outside Austin for past 7 months. We celebrated 'Durga Puja', 'Christmas', 'New Year' in Austin but something was missing!!! So, I took the initiative and planned a very short trip to the nearest city, Dallas. We both wanted some relaxation and refreshment. Did we get that in Dallas?? WoW, yeaahhh... We visited the historic Texas city with lot of cultural heritages and true history of the state.

I have posted several recipes on khichdi but 'bhoger khichuri' is the basic one. You can make this simple khichdi on 'puja' / vrat days as they are onion and garlic free.

'Phuchka' is nothing but hollow chips with spicy potato mixture in the center and then filled with tangy water. So, so, so good and tastes million bucks ! Every single description will be short in comparison to a plate of 'phuchka'. As I used store bought chips, so, I am sharing only the recipe of potato filling and tangy water.

After few trials I finally created the exact taste of Kolkata's one of the famous street food - 'kobiraji cutlet'. Kobiraji means coverage or lace like texture, which you can create with beaten egg. I know they are not at all healthy but they tastes insanely delicious. So, my advice - don't avoid them but eat once in three months ?. I used minced mutton for this dish, you can also use minced chicken or fish fillets. Everytime you will fall in love with them after the first bite, believe me.

My husband and I both fell in love with the second version and tried so many of them from different restaurants. Professionally 'shawarma' is made by stacking the seasoned meat on a spit and then roasted slowly in front of a flame for hours.

'Rogan' means oil / fat and 'josh' means intense heat. The dish is an aromatic mutton curry which is cooked in oil on high flame. It is slightly different than the usual mutton curries because of the usage of some unique dry seasonings. Rogan josh can be prepared in two ways - one with onion and garlic, the other one is with yogurt and without onion, garlic. Kashmiri pandits cook this dish by following the second method. I also tried the 'no onion, no garlic' recipe and the taste came out phenomenal. The gravy may seems super spicy but actually it is mildly spicy. The authentic recipe calls for dry ginger (saut) powder and 'ratanjot' (for red colour), I didn't have those so I have used some grated ginger and kashmiri red chilli powder.

You can never underestimate it because sometimes 'pulao' itself can be very rich and attractive like 'yakhni pulao', 'prawn pulao', 'sweet pulao' and so on. Today I am sharing the recipe of 'hara pulao' which is the easiest and tastiest one. I flavoured the rice with a spicy green coriander paste and that's why the taste was damn good ! Try this easy recipe in your kitchen and let me know how it turns out for you.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR vegItem-1"></tr></table></div><br/><div class='topPaginationData'><span><a class="recipes-pagination-prev" title="My Recipes - Page 8" href='recipes-8.html'>&lt;</a></span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 1" href='recipes.html'>1</a></span><span>...</span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 9" href='recipes-8.html'>9</a></span><span class="selected">10</span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 11" href='recipes-10.html'>11</a></span><span>...</span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 18" href='recipes-17.html'>18</a></span><span><a class="recipes-pagination-next" title="My Recipes - Page 10" href='recipes-10.html'>&gt;</a></span></div><div class='clear'>&nbsp;</div>
