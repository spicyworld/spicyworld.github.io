'Phuchka' is nothing but hollow chips with spicy potato mixture in the center and then filled with tangy water. So, so, so good and tastes million bucks ! Every single description will be short in comparison to a plate of 'phuchka'. As I used store bought chips, so, I am sharing only the recipe of potato filling and tangy water.

You can make 5 parathas with these proportions and serve them with pickles, raita or veg / non veg curry. These parathas can also be served in lunch box.

After few trials I finally created the exact taste of Kolkata's one of the famous street food - 'kobiraji cutlet'. Kobiraji means coverage or lace like texture, which you can create with beaten egg. I know they are not at all healthy but they tastes insanely delicious. So, my advice - don't avoid them but eat once in three months ?. I used minced mutton for this dish, you can also use minced chicken or fish fillets. Everytime you will fall in love with them after the first bite, believe me.

I made mine on dry side, but if you want this on gravy side, just add more water or vegetable stock. Both of them tastes incredible and you can serve them as starter or as maincourse also.

Shawarma' is a middle eastern kabab preparation which can be made of lamb / chicken / turkey or beef. I had them first time with pilaf and second time with pita bread. My husband and I both fell in love with the second version and tried so many of them from different restaurants. Professionally 'shawarma' is made by stacking the seasoned meat on a spit and then roasted slowly in front of a flame for hours. At home we can't get that facility .. so don't worry, make them on tawa or flat pan and enjoy the same taste and texture of 'shawarma'.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR nonVegItem-1"></tr><tr class="nonVegItem-1"><td><div style='clear:both;width:100%'><div class='leftitem' style=""><a href='nature-with-canon.html'><img title='A Trip with Nature / Canon EOS Rebel T6i' alt='A Trip with Nature / Canon EOS Rebel T6i' src="../recipeimages/nature-with-canon.jpg?sessionId=306"/></a></div><div class="rightitem"><div class="title"><div><a alt="A Trip with Nature / Canon EOS Rebel T6i" title="A Trip with Nature / Canon EOS Rebel T6i" class='noStyle' href="nature-with-canon.html">A Trip with Nature / Canon EOS Rebel T6i</a>&nbsp;(Featured Post)</div></div><div class="desc">Travel is always exciting, and travel with a new camera is more exciting.

'Rogan' means oil / fat and 'josh' means intense heat. The dish is an aromatic mutton curry which is cooked in oil on high flame. It is slightly different than the usual mutton curries because of the usage of some unique dry seasonings. Rogan josh can be prepared in two ways - one with onion and garlic, the other one is with yogurt and without onion, garlic. Kashmiri pandits cook this dish by following the second method. I also tried the 'no onion, no garlic' recipe and the taste came out phenomenal. The gravy may seems super spicy but actually it is mildly spicy. The authentic recipe calls for dry ginger (saut) powder and 'ratanjot' (for red colour), I didn't have those so I have used some grated ginger and kashmiri red chilli powder.

Mousse has very light and fluffy texture that's why I love to eat it. Sometimes, to me, after having heavy meals rich dessert becomes overpowering, in those case 'mousse' is very good option. I made my mousse with mango puree and without egg, gelatin. With only three ingredients you can achieve such a lovely and quick dessert.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR vegItem-1"></tr></table></div><br/><div class='topPaginationData'><span><a class="recipes-pagination-prev" title="My Recipes - Page 8" href='recipes-8.html'>&lt;</a></span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 1" href='recipes.html'>1</a></span><span>...</span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 9" href='recipes-8.html'>9</a></span><span class="selected">10</span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 11" href='recipes-10.html'>11</a></span><span>...</span><span><a class="recipes-pagination" title="My Recipes - Page 18" href='recipes-17.html'>18</a></span><span><a class="recipes-pagination-next" title="My Recipes - Page 10" href='recipes-10.html'>&gt;</a></span></div><div class='clear'>&nbsp;</div>
