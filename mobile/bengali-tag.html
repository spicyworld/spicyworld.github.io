We eat fish in many forms like thick curry (kaliya), thin curry (jhol), batter fried, shallow fried (mach vaja), steamed version (vapa) and so on. One of the popular among them is 'fried fish'. Now in this category also we have so many variations. The most simple one is shallow fried marinated (with salt and turmeric) fish and the complicated one is 'Fish Roll'. In this recipe fish fillets will be stuffed with spicy fish and shrimp filling then they will get a coating of breadcrumbs and at last deep fry them until golden ... it's the example of our ultimate love towards fish ?? . The hard part is making the roll, except that step, everything is easy. The taste of fish roll is phenomenal.

After reading the ingredients you will wonder why spinach leaves? 6 blanched spinach leaves wont spoil the taste, rather it will give the curry a nice green color. Heat will only come from green chilies that's why there is no use of dry red chilies in this recipe. It's a delicious curry and best for summer days.

To make an excellent Chicken Bharta you have to finish it off with boiled egg yolk. In Kolkata it's a frequently ordered dish in restaurants. To bring that exact flavor of restaurant I have used 'tandoori masala', believe me, do not skip this masala because it will definitely give the taste a big uplift.

One of my favourite veggie is 'green peas' / Koraishuti. You can make so many items with these tiny green balls like, 'matar paneer', 'peas kachori', 'dum aloo with peas', 'khichdi', 'veg daal', 'cabbage curry with peas' etc. But 'fish curry with green peas paste' may seems new to somebody. Its nothing but a dry fish curry with a tasty extra addition of green peas paste - as simple as that. When I was in school, on 1 of my birthday, mom made this special fish curry for me. That was the first and also last time I ate this dish, but still can remember the unique taste. So, two days before I thought to make something new with fish, suddenly remembered about this one. Immediately I gave a call to mom and asked for the recipe. She told me, I followed every line of her and Taaddaaa... a spicy+sweet+tangy fish curry came out from my kitchen. Please let me know how it turns out for you.</div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="blankTR nonVegItem-1"></tr><tr class="nonVegItem-1"><td><div style='clear:both;width:100%'><div class='leftitem' style=""><a href='ginger-mutton.html'><img title='Adabata aar kacha-lonkar Mutton / Mutton curry with ginger and green chilies' alt='Adabata aar kacha-lonkar Mutton / Mutton curry with ginger and green chilies' src="../recipeimages/ginger-mutton.jpg?sessionId=306"/></a></div><div class="rightitem"><div class="title"><div><a alt="Adabata aar kacha-lonkar Mutton / Mutton curry with ginger and green chilies" title="Adabata aar kacha-lonkar Mutton / Mutton curry with ginger and green chilies" class='noStyle' href="ginger-mutton.html">Adabata aar kacha-lonkar Mutton / Mutton curry with ginger and green chilies</a>&nbsp;(NonVeg Item)</div></div><div class="desc">Few days before I saw a fantastic picture of mutton curry in facebook.
