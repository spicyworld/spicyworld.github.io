Our hotel Doubletree Hilton was in downtown, so we had to take the <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/blueline/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: CTA Blueline', this.href);">CTA Blue line</a> train ($5 each) from airport to Washington station in Downtown Chicago.

Its the easiest, nicest and cheapest way to get into Chicago downtown. No problem of traffic jam or any other hassles.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-ce38e067-016a-47ba-b264-209c6d1a5b2b.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-17d44fbf-a943-4613-a900-7fc08db37023.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-bc5ecf42-182d-46ac-a16b-966c8748f146.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>We were tremendously hungry when we reached there downtown. So, tracked down a restaurant named '<a href="http://roti.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Roti Mediterranean Grill', this.href);">Roti Mediterranean Grill</a>' which was the nearest one from the Blueline train station. The place was fully  crowded and very similar to Chipotle.</div><div>We ordered 2 plates ($21) of rice bowl with chicken kebab, onion, hummus, tomato & cucumber, hot sauce and pita bread. Food was delicious. The rice was very flavorful and quantity was also pretty good. They have veg (falafel) option also.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-4c887cb8-df41-41ef-b55d-88b97b25f47b.jpg" /><div>After finishing our lunch we headed towards '<a href="http://www.artic.edu/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: The Art Institute of Chicago', this.href);">The Art Institute of Chicago</a>' and the famous 'Swami Vivekanand Way'. After 8 minutes walk we reached there. It's a beautiful building with two lion statues in front. Swamiji represented India and gave speech - 'Sisters and brothers of America ...', at the Parliament of religion which was occurred inside this famous building.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9c8c1e7f-7411-4088-9690-5d6adeafc9d0.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-5d79a527-bb0d-4912-89ee-cd4c5b485251.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-23523f92-0956-4de0-92f8-da4d7d596867.jpg" /><div>We also went to the Chicago River walk ... don't ever miss this walk, it is charming and wonderful. After that we looked at the clock and it was 2.00pm. So, decided to go to the hotel (<a href="http://www.doubletreemagmile.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Chicago - Magnificent Mile', this.href);">DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Chicago - Magnificent Mile</a>) as the check in time was 3.00pm and also we were tired. Our room ($181 per day) was on 20th floor. It was very clean as expected. The bed, towel, sofa, toilette were very impressive. Although you can't keep your personal drink in the fridge as it was filled with their expensive (!!) drinks, they should keep some empty spot for us so that we can keep our own stuffs, which is a bit awkward for us.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-12495fd7-0d29-4536-9636-20f7e48163e4.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-24274922-e12f-4ef4-b882-6ca43833cb86.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>After taking a short nap and freshen up, we went to the famous <a href="https://navypier.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Navy Pier of Chicago', this.href);">Navy Pier of Chicago</a>.</div><div class='videoIframeDiv'><div class="videoDiv"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2UVG48n83BQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div>It is a beautiful place with splendid views and filled with life. We took an Chicago Architectural Boat Tour ($35 per person) which was 75 minutes long water journey into Chicago river.</div><div class='videoIframeDiv'><div class="videoDiv"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJsl1yWzB_Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div>The boat covered almost the whole city and the tour guide gave very informative descriptions about the buildings of Chicago. As that afternoon was very hot, we got exhausted after an hour. So, I will recommend you to take this type of trip after 6 or 7pm in the summer days.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-252c9ce9-7a50-4cb1-b52d-afa450a7acf5.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-bb71c203-2972-48d3-9c7b-b3feaac486c3.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-cf66220e-ce04-4883-b7e6-84656284480c.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-f0f4575e-c477-4032-a1e6-e38de1ce9969.jpg" /><div>While the boat left us at the Navy Pier at the end of the trip, we bought an awesome looking ice cream cone and started our journey towards the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Water_Tower" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Chicago Water Tower', this.href);">Chicago Water Tower</a>. We took a bus, it took about 8 minutes to go there.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1d3fa4fa-8523-49d4-91a2-bf4652e5452f.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>The tower is located at North Michigan Avenue. It is the second oldest water tower in USA. The story says, this tower was the only building which survived the Chicago Fire and also it is one of the few surviving structures still standing. But it must be a place to visit if you are in Chicago.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-87e989a9-fddb-4683-907f-d470deab7f8b.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>While coming back from the water tower we suddenly tracked down an indian restaurant - '<a href="http://www.indiangardenchicago.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Indian Garden', this.href);">Indian Garden</a>' which was few foot steps away from our hotel. The ambience of that place was pretty decent and many tables were filled with people. We placed an order ($37) for - a chicken dum biriyani, a chicken korma and a butter naan.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-c4d2b134-bd20-4f2d-ab18-75ad21be7a0f.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-e7c52051-eb00-44f5-b31e-f7f141f123a6.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-6ca1ecf0-f4a6-4544-8dbf-1ebb65dccbb8.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1c798196-b3c6-4a8f-a2b6-599c80780e94.jpg" /><div>Well, the 'biriyani' was just a mixture of chicken curry and rice, you can see that from the pictures, it came with a 'raita' which was good. Korma was ok, there was no complementary rice with it! But their 'naan' was very soft and fresh. They also served 'papad' and 3 types of chutney as a complimentary starter which was really tasty. Overall food was totally overpriced.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d10e7bd5-023b-433b-935b-ee2a33670893.jpg" /><div>We started our next day with little breakfast ($8) from Dunkin Donuts, which was very close to our hotel - 1 egg n cheese croissant, 1 pack of hash browns, 1 vanilla chai and 1 frozen hot chocolate .... delicious !</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-de92b810-8a30-422a-a27e-291b4e977f3d.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d8e96630-7923-481e-9a64-a5628bcc6a24.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1105fd24-29bd-4eeb-bd42-e9017fdb3867.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>Our first destination was '<a href="http://theskydeck.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Willis Tower', this.href);">Willis Tower</a>' also called as Sears Towers. We took <a href="https://www.lyft.com/invite/AMITAVA488489" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Lyft', this.href);">Lyft</a> and got there within 10 minutes. It's 108 storied and the 2nd tallest building of USA. The famous sky-deck is located at 103rd floor of the tower. Elevators will take you there within quick time.  It is the most popular attraction point in Chicago. The view from that floor was marvelous. We spent 2 memorable hours within it.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-6ef87b76-5999-4ef4-a249-eb2cf1f8ff89.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-c1a38e21-4177-4de3-bd86-b89a2311b1c8.jpg" /><div class='videoIframeDiv'><div class="videoDiv"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HppFMPaasKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-431648f8-4a6e-4b57-8e22-dfa40044a257.jpg" /><div>Then our next stop was '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Fountain" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Buckingham Fountain', this.href);">Buckingham Fountain</a>' which is located at the '<a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/grant-park/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Grant Park', this.href);">Grant Park</a>'. The fountain is a landmark of Chicago. Many tourists and locals visit the fountain every day. It's one of the very beautiful place in Chicago. Water (light) shows occur from evening to night. We couldn't get the chance to see it as their gate was closed for a concert. But morning view was very refreshing and wonderful.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9a3d1522-afd3-4c91-a0f8-db35f634ca36.jpg" /><div>Another famous point is <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/millennium_park.html" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Millennium Park', this.href);">Millennium Park</a> walkable distance from Grant Park.

We all know, it was designed by an Indian artist - Anish Kapoor. The sculpture is named 'the bean' because of its shape, made with mercury and it reflects the city's beautiful skyline. The morning view was totally different from the night view. Both were very impressive.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-8c82b42e-c84d-4be6-9234-bd2a5ead9e9b.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-5b4b32bf-1a1b-4097-9487-e872c3cd09b6.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-0ce1ddba-8064-4662-ac48-425d10c6faab.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>After finishing these, we got very much tired and hungry. One of the legendary food item of Chicago is - Deep dish Pizza and we had it at <a href="http://www.unos.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Uno Pizza', this.href);">Uno Pizzeria & Grill: Uno Chicago Grill - Deep Dish Pizza</a>. Our server Phill was very helpful and decent. We ordered for a small (really enough for two of us) deep dish pizza with chicken, onion and jalapeños. It was delicious. They took 45 minutes to make it but the wait was totally worthy. The pizza was hot, fresh and very heavy. After that we wanted to taste Chicago style 'cheesecake', well it was nothing fancy, just like a very normal cheesecake. Overall our experience was very very good at this busiest restaurant.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9e4fe450-dd04-4b55-885c-f0508c241a0d.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-f34b462c-4358-403a-abef-0a5fb7622dba.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-8b04442d-cbc9-4b9a-8b4a-bc0b717c5d67.jpg" /><div>At the evening we again went at the Cloud Gate to see the evening view of The Bean. You can say from the pictures that it is wonderful and the place is very happening. The street was packed with traffic and we got late for our dinner.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d56ab2ad-e00f-4ebb-90c6-f2cab7dceb9f.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-12c794f5-e29b-494c-bc43-4df90c7ffd6d.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-0fda35b8-685a-4b02-ad05-d6063f3be9d1.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-0ad6c0f6-c8db-4ca2-a723-e6f106859648.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-b533459b-f8bd-4955-aa59-542d4a03d367.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>I eyed a spanish restaurant named 'Emilio's Tapas' from the first day which was very nearby from our hotel. So we got into an Lyft to get there quickly for our late night dinner. Ahh, the experience was awful. At first we placed 3 orders - a salad plate with duck breast, a casserole of chicken and a grilled calamari plate. The quantity of them were surprisingly less / tiny. Salad was good, my casserole was also ok, but calamari plate had a very burnt taste. Then we again placed order for a chicken item and they gave us beef. After that shamelessly they charged us $48 and the server was not even sorry for serving beef instead of Chicken ... what the hell !!</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-71edbc3c-01cd-47fb-83b0-b473a9496350.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-802d061a-8dc3-416e-b399-82130a5409ce.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-f8fcedbe-6478-4a46-82a6-40f6555f4c96.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9bcab44e-6b0d-4c58-8c0b-3c08581c0495.jpg" /><div>Next day we again had the same breakfast with a refreshing mango smoothie instead of hot chocolate. It was a very relaxing day for us, the sky was filled with clouds, breeze was lightly cold and we walked the entire day upon '<a href="https://www.themagnificentmile.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Magnificent Mile', this.href);">The Magnificent Mile</a>'. It's a famous road, packed with upscale shops and small size shopping malls.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-80524215-d7a2-4dbc-8cbb-74703f8ce293.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-5466b2cc-b3c1-47a3-9b5d-e7e348a4ba90.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-11c28525-2675-4e79-bf1d-ddf06cce3e63.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1d19cf75-e876-4c3a-ad4a-7c50799356b1.jpg" /><div>When there is a <a href="http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Cheesecake Factory', this.href);">Cheesecake Factory</a>, there is always a big smile you can find on 'his' face. He is a crazy fan of them. So, as usual we had our lunch ($42) there - Dynamic Shrimp, White Chicken Chili and Factory Chicken Nachos there. The batter fried shrimp was the star and you can never complain about their quantity. We loved the other 2 Mexican dishes too. Just mind blowing nothing to complain about.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-a542c88d-b463-461d-aa23-c221451167f9.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-3bfcae22-a8fa-4f01-9b08-fb5610d528f1.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d0186dd9-8932-4090-a029-ae4377b44eaf.jpg" /><div>After returning to the hotel, the rain started and the weather became more romantic. We went to the 'Navy Pier' again to enjoy the evening. And yeaahhh the decision was perfect. The sky became totally clear by then. We spent 4 long hours there and then had our dinner.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/we-at-chicago-fa72cd3d-548e-4f90-95ec-163b14822e13.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-22135803-9461-4f53-ab9d-f1c35613f9c1.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-542c6954-0309-4bad-aafd-6ee8633769b3.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-04fc371a-cf71-44f7-a665-7fc59a44d58e.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>There were plenty of restaurants filled with people. One of them was '<a href="http://www.dmkrestaurants.com/restaurants/fish-bar/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: DMKs Fish Bar', this.href);">DMK's Fish Bar</a>'. We went there and our order was ($48) - 2 ginger ale, 1 spicy turkey burger, 1 crispy calamari and 1 fish and chips. Calamari was very good, topped with some cheese and pickled jalapeños. In my burger-  the bun was very soft, patty tasted good, just didn't like the cheese. The battered cod fish fillets were so crunchy and delicious. The thing we disliked was their french fries - they were very soggy, otherwise everything else was spot on.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-74d51f0a-6776-4dc5-aa7e-5f4c5ded9262.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-b17abf64-74b6-4cf5-8f83-05ccbf6b0d75.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-85a9b965-27ae-41bf-a2a7-6b83f442a261.jpg" /><div>This was the last day of our trip, we were leaving Chicago. Started with very light and yummy breakfast we brought previous day night from 711 - 1 marble cake and 2 bananas. Then checked out from the hotel and went to the airport. While reaching there we got an email that our flight is delayed for 1 hour ... bummer ! After the security check, we had lunch - chicken shawarma, spicy chicken burger with fries from 'Gold Coast Dogs'. My shawarma was good, french fries were very crunchy, but his burger was no at all spicy.</div><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-7919a733-874d-4eba-9dc2-8ae4c939cb81.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-a63d4d48-dfe0-496e-812f-d3d1509b4463.jpg" /><img alt="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" title="Cooking Step: We at Chicago" src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-3e0dbec5-f814-4b0d-a9b1-b8892f3a01e6.jpg" /><div>After waiting for 1 hour they again announced for another 3 hours delay due to bad weather.
