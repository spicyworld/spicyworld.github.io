        <type>vegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[During sankranti apart from <a href="ros-bora.html">Rosh Bora</a> my another favorite is Patisapta. It is very similar to Crepe. You can stuff the Patisapta with various kinds of stuffing like kheer, coconut mixture, sandesh, naru etc. The batter of Patisapta is lightly sweetened with sugar or jaggery and the stuffing has to be sweetened with jaggery only. The right proportion of the ingredients and the freshness of the stuffing is the secret of the recipe. Do give this a try and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

        <process><![CDATA[<div>We visited Lost Maples back to back two years, so we will try to narrate the story that way you can plan your visit properly based upon our experience.</div><div>The website of <a href="https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/lost-maples/foliage-reports" target="_blank">Texas Parks and Wildlife</a> lists the best time of the year when you can see the Fall color. It has the page for "Fall Foliage Color Report" which is updated with details. So keep following the reports and plan in a weekend.</div><div>The trip should start at early morning because in peak season the park is full and wait time or to get a parking is very tough. Make sure to bring water and light food with you as there are not really any good foos option around.</div><div><b><u>Lost Maples State Park:</u></b><br/></div><div>First stop should be at the Lost Maples State Park where you can see most of the colors, so the trip should start with that. For us it was 86miles which takes about 1hr 45minutes, the drive is beautiful. (From San Antonio north).</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-57eac540-21c0-4e0e-bf7e-e50ddd38ee4f.jpg" /><div>We started around 7AM and reach by 9AM. You need to get the entry passes which will cost $6 per person. Then proceed inside the park & secure a parking. The parking area is quite big but on a peak season finding a good parking is tough and may delay the trip.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-57bf2003-9b4d-4e5b-be87-fb3d3113dcfa.jpg" /><div>The parking area is big and it has plenty of small trees and those change their color. A very good place to play with your kid. They can run around, so we did spent quite few minutes there. Also if you bring some food, there are tables where you can eat, but I will only recommend eating fruits as you are inside nature.</div><div>After spending & playing with our kid we started walking down the trails, our kid was very much excited and he stop on every step and start picking stuffs, there is a nice little river along the trail we walked. Its a beautiful place and some white rocks were there which is a good place for the kid to play.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-9a2c9393-02da-4d32-8cef-92749119f6ab.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-0a74b3bf-a88e-4e95-8510-ba29ee20a945.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-91827f38-b7bb-49ed-9286-ba73ded47748.jpg" /><div>After spending few minutes, the walk started, its quite a bit rocky but beautiful. Following are some clips of the trails. We stop for rest in few places and enjoyed the walk.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-08b3f3bc-c009-45f0-8259-5c03ad286b94.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-bf11c643-0a95-4387-95ee-fe9a7c77d220.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-793b7c39-40b6-4fb5-9800-598aa3640378.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-f6082319-0eae-4f26-93d5-32819498d394.jpg" /><div>As Coco (our kid) is small, so we couldn't complete the entire trail and decided to leave and visit the next park which is Garner State Park. And we started for that and on the way stopped at Leakey, Texas (a small city) for a quick lunch.</div><div><b><u>Garner State Park:</u></b><br/></div><div>We went to the visitor center and show them the pass from Lost Maples and they said we do not need to buy the pass again and they just renewed the pass for Garner State Park. Which is very good. We came to know the day pass is valid for any state parks for a day as many time as you want to enter.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-1ac12748-4f45-487d-9720-d4958d060632.jpg" /><div>This park is a very good place to be and do camping, we noticed lot of family with kids doing camping. Kids were playing and so we parked the car and started playing with our kid too. The river side is very beautiful and we spent about an hour there.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-1ddb3722-da5b-4fc3-ac77-4281d3aeb3b7.jpg" /><div>With this out day trip ended, we started driving back to San Antonio.</div><div>Overall our experience was quite good and we appreciate the way the parks are maintained and the staffs are so helpful and informative. So, why sitting around, go out and have fun and enjoy with friends and family in Fall season.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-fall-lost-maples-42c5520c-bc1a-4200-a108-539321f00745.jpg" />]]></process>

        <process><![CDATA[<div><b><u>Tour Starts:</u></b><br/></div><div>We started our journey on 22nd September, it started by an early wake up alarm at 2AM and then usual stuffs, it starts with a tasty tea!!! After getting ready we called the <a href="https://www.lyft.com/i/AMITAVA25112?utm_medium=p2da_iacc" target="_blank">Lyft</a> to take us to the airport, it took $15 from our apartment to airport terminal (Frontier airlines terminal) which is quite reasonable for 8 miles ride at 4AM. The driver was super friendly.</div><div>We checked in our baggage which was just 48lbs (<50lbs) so we are good, make sure to measure the weight before you arrive at airport to avoid any additional expenditure at airport counter. We did the security check, <b>Learning</b> for the kids (ours is just 2.5years) you do not need to show the ID card at the TSA checkpoint and they can have their shoes on as well. But you cann't carry a sealed bottle of water even. We had one bottle so we drank the entire bottle of water!! Post check in we entered in the terminal and Coco (our little one) started playing and enjoying by running here and there which was quite a bit fun.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-660d067d-5920-4974-ac3f-49dedad1ec1b.jpg"  style='width:85%'/><div>We boarded the plane and it was on time, Coco traveled when he was 9 months and most of the time he was sleeping and this time he is a grown up buy so he initially was surprised when we entered in the aircraft but then he started enjoying too & soon after the flight take off he went to sleep. <b>Learning</b>, you must carry a small pillow or neck rest for the kids in case they are sitting in their own seat as the seat is wide for them to keep their head straight. And obviously we did not have that which is why he leaned on both of us on time to time basis.</div><div>After we landed, we picked up the check-in bag and changed the kid's diaper then we were picked up by Hertz shuttle bus which come in Island #4 in Denver Intl airport, we had to wait for 5 minutes for the bus to come and pick us up. They took us to the Rental Place where we booked our car rental, <b>Learning</b>, as we booked via AAA so the child seat was included as part of the rental as free. Initially we picked up a car which has low tire pressure, we asked for a different car and then they gave us a 7300 miles car, Subaru Outback. Driving a mid-size SUV we thought will be difficult but after hitting the road within 10 minutes it became the most likely thing to drive. We drove ~1100 miles in 5 days. <b>Learning</b>, you need to first know every switches and buttons before hitting the road, because newer cars has plenty of censors and buttons for almost everything.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-3b177cc5-611c-46b6-ac00-252111c437f6.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>We stopped at a Walmart to pickup some important stuffs for the kid & his food as he loves food prepared by mom, e.g. few potato, onion, tomato, vegetable oil etc. We bring rice, daal, salt, sugar with us. And we booked our hotels in advance and all of them has kitchen included so that we can cook for him.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-83a46e76-1261-4f14-99b4-b5d5764ad391.jpg"  style='width:85%'/><div><b><u>Day 1 (290miles / 22nd September 2019):</u></b><br/></div><div>We started the longest road journey towards Grand Junction which is about 280miles from Denver International Airport. In the morning we stopped at McDonald's and had some breakfast and made Coco eat something so that he is prepared for the long road trip. We stopped at Vail (after 120miles), its a small city named after Charles Vail (Highway engineer), it mainly offers Ski and it has lots of beautiful looking ski resorts. We stopped there and walked a little bit to stretch ourselves.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-56001126-5e83-46f9-ac2a-9381fac90bdc.jpg"  style='width:85%'/><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-634227bd-80e2-434b-b7c1-292837188b72.jpg" /><div>Then we started again towards Grand Junction, and the road after Eagle was beautiful. We had a quick lunch at a Subway in Eagle and fueled the car. I-70 (Interstate 70) is in 2 layers and the mountains are gorgeous on the way. We crossed Glenwood Springs and reached our hotel in Grand Junction which is another 150miles.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-7b4e7a4e-cc97-4032-bf2a-a575cc1c9aba.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-ddc08673-0279-4166-9e8c-dc820779eb37.jpg" /><div>On the way we stopped at Mount Garfield which is close to Grand Junction and it has a different color texture. The day ended with a nice dinner at our favorite Chili's Grill & Bar.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-9feece3a-7c06-45cd-89be-cc71cb1f692a.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-d846b3fe-8701-472c-ade6-038e0cef7782.jpg" /><div><b><u>Day 2 (187miles / 23rd September 2019):</u></b><br/></div><div>We initially planned to visit the Arches National Park which is located in Utah but then decided not to end up driving 400miles for the day, instead we visited the beautiful "Colorado National Monument" in the morning after having a quick breakfast at Taco Bell. With this the tough driving started in the mountain roads. <b>Learning</b>, It has some roads which are really tough to drive with a non AWD or 4x4 car.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-616a3be0-526a-4003-987c-f68bb2421a8e.jpg" /><div>We re-fuled the car and started heading towards Glenwood Springs & had to stop to feed Coco in a rest area in Parachute. It was a sunny day, so Coco enjoyed few minutes with Mom by walking around the place.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-e7ce5349-405b-4442-acde-4de8881ca1b2.jpg" /><div>We started again, next stop was Glenwood Springs, We parked the car at the entrance of "Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park" (parking here is free) and then we took the Gondola Ride ($19 per person and under 3 years it's free) to go to the actual park which is located at the top of the mountain. The gondolas are covered and can hold 4 to 6 persons and we took the baby stroller in it. We get down from the Gondola and the part is really beautiful, if you are adventure lover, you must take all the rides and the cave tour as well (we wanted to have the cave tour but the baby stroller is not allowed in there), if you want to take all the tours you must but the entire pass before boarding the Gondola and the cave tour has its own price as well. But the park was at the top of the mountain and you can get down from the Gondola and spend as much time as you can. It's quite beautiful. <b>Learning</b>, you must go on a weekday to avoid crowd which we did!!! We took the Gondola back to come down. By now its already 2PM there, so we quickly stopped at a Subway to have a quick lunch and go back to the action.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-e113e51b-79b4-4c4a-8b90-2b10eb187724.jpg" /><div>We stopped at the Glenwood Hot Spring pool and it was nice to see lot of people out there. We did not go into the pool instead we started heading towards our next hotel in Eagle & we were mainly preserving our energy to see some beautiful scenic roads from Glenwood Springs to Eagle which we noticed the day prior. <b>Learning</b>, if you want to go into water in Glenwood Hot Spring, the parking is very tight even in the weekdays, so plan early and definitely bring your own swim suites or else you can rent them as well.</div><div>We stopped at a beautiful river side (Eagle River) rest area "CDOT Rest Area: Bair Ranch" (as per Google map's timeline), I think its Exit 121 on I-70. It has a nice park where you can walk in green grass, sit and relax also you can put your feet down into the river water. We stopped there and spent about 30 minutes and Coco really enjoyed by running around the place. <b>Learning</b>, we took the next exit and it was a dead-end, so keep some time in hand and plan for driving 10miles to comeback to where you took a wrong exit, this is because there are some constructions & maintenance going on in few places.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-033b864e-5ad5-45a9-b223-5dfbe756d028.jpg" /><div>Finally the day ended by reaching at our hotel in Eagle and with a delicious Chinese food at "Gourmet China".</div><div><b><u>Day 3 (209miles / 24th September 2019):</u></b><br/></div><div>Morning started early as we target to visit the Aspen's beautiful Maroon Bells, we fueled the car the previous night. To visit Maroon Bells by your own car (driving) you need to enter before 8AM, although we started at 6AM due to a wrong exit we had to spent additional 30minutes and that took us a while to reach and we end up parking our car at "The Ritz Carlton Destination Club" which is at "Aspen Highlands", which costs $10 for parking. Then we boarded the shuttle bus which starts in every 15/20minutes from there and take you to the Maroon Bells, the bus costed $8 per person and kids like Coco is free there. The bus ride was in-fact quite cool, the drive shared lots of info about the place, the history, the community around the place and the avalanches & their destruction.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-af5d3962-922b-4b92-a3d1-89a7442562d5.jpg" /><div>We spent few hours there by the lake and the mountains, it is very beautiful sight and the walk is pretty much awesome. It was a bit cold as its at an elevation of 14,000ft. So we had to wear jackets and for Coco the greatest of all "<b>Monkey Cap</b>". But after walking a bit we started getting tired due to less oxygen and also we need to get rid of the jackets. We took the shuttle bus back from there and comeback to the parking spot.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-d9dcaf2e-d1d6-4f39-86cf-159cee2d4d66.jpg" /><div>If you have plans to visit Independence pass, which was in our bucket list, you must eat here only to enter into the Independence Pass because there is no restaurants or fast food places after this spot for next 45miles. <b>Learning</b>, also if you are less in gas, you must put some at this point because the road around Independence Pass is very much hilly and that requires lot of gas and the next gas station is after 45 - 50miles.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-810275ec-e341-449b-b25b-342fe41fec85.jpg" /><div>The Independence Pass was a superb driving experience, the yellow colors were every where and the views were awesome in the fall. The mountains, the nature everything was colorful around this drive. There are some tight curves on the way and some spots where you need to stop your car and give others to pass which is fun activity.</div><div>We stopped at Twin lake, which is at the other side of Independence Pass, stretched our legs and then started for the hotel at Eagle (the hotel from previous night). We stopped few times on the way whenever we find some scenic place. Coco enjoyed running here are there and we played and enjoyed that quite a lot. Finally we reached hotel and our Day 3 has come to an end with some quick dinner from Subway.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-ae7b81e9-0d11-404c-ae88-2196457f255e.jpg" /><div><b><u>Day 4 (189miles / 25th September 2019):</u></b><br/></div><div>Day 4 started with an adventure, the road was not quite good towards "Grand Lake" from our hotel. But after driving about 2hours for 98miles we reached the most beautiful & clean city of the entire trip so far. There we parked our car and had our breakfast. Mountains everywhere, Coco enjoyed playing in the green grass. The roads were empty as its 10AM in the morning. Only tourists but again as its middle of the week its not at all crowded. After spending an hour there we started for the ultimate destination. Guess what?? yes .... its in next paragraph.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-268e1401-96dc-4c03-aa14-850a317b5255.jpg" /><div>Yes we entered in the "Rocky Mountain National Park", the road is absolute beautiful and they charged $25 for a day pass, totally worth it. We drive through some difficult mountain roads (you must have gas in your car to avoid panic of calling someone for gas!!!), finally reached 11,796ft high "Alpine Visitor Center". <b>Learning</b>, It's windy out there, you need to have proper winter dress. You can also see some snow here and there. Once again Coco has his "Monkey Cap" on and we had our jackets on. The valley down below looks awesome.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-15cd685e-80a8-44b1-b61c-8cdb3918aae5.jpg" /><div>We spent about an hour there and then started going towards the other end of the park, towards "Estates Park" via Rainbow Curve Overlook and once again the beautiful mountain roads are still inviting us. We reached at "Estates Park" and had our lunch at a restaurant called "Thai Kitchen" (obviously after refueling the car), but it has Indian food too. Coco doesn't like rice and daal, so we had to take him to McDonald's for his favorite kids meal.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-ab33635a-6087-4735-8d9e-e15d0f86312e.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-9a32d1fd-3edb-43cd-bb08-fed156f1f913.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-4beb0a8b-621c-43b6-9523-0e14891f5ee2.jpg" /><div>After that we started driving towards our hotel at Denver (Glendale/ Cherry Creek), on the way we spent some time in "Colorado State Capitol".</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-7002fb62-d28c-4865-9307-bfb3d3d6c677.jpg" /><div><b><u>Day 5 (169miles / 26th September 2019):</u></b><br/></div><div>We are supposed to get into a flight at 9:15PM in the evening, as the checkouts are at 11AM from hotel, so we decided not to extend the hotel for those few hours instead visit Garden of the Gods which is near Colorado Springs. It was a good choice. We started at 10:30AM and reached by 11:45PM. It was less crowded as its weekday. The visitor center is well maintained and has lots of info available about the place. They have a nice place in the 1st floor from where you can take some nice pictures of "Garden of the Gods".

Learning, we cann't go for the cave tours because they don't allow baby strollers. We decided not to go to Pikes Peak because the drive it going to take sometime (not far from here but as you need to go on top of the mountain its a bit time taking drive), and after looking at the Alpine visitor center its more or less the similar place so we skipped that.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-d4fd68ab-dc7b-4c98-8e58-c65b7895df3f.jpg" /><div>We drive back to return our rental car and on the way we had very good late lunch at the our favorite "Chili's Grill & Bar" near Monument, Colorado.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-5c843aa6-fbc6-4910-85e8-04929687f5ca.jpg" /><div>We reached at Denver Airport and checked in our baggage around 5PM by the return shuttle of the rental & had dinner with mixed food from Panda Express and McDonald's, McDonald's was for Coco only, but he ate my Fried Rice from Panda Express.</div><div>The flight was on-time, we took Lyft to comeback to our sweet apartment at 1AM.</div><img src="recipeimages/fall-trip-colorado-fd775eeb-d355-4163-adcc-64bd1160b156.jpg" /><div><br/><b><u>Tour Ends:</u></b><br/></div><div>Hope you enjoyed reading about our trip and get to know lot of info about the Colorado, so if you or your friend wants to visit Colorado and see the beautiful places around Colorado, please read or refer this blog.</div>]]></process>

        <type>nonVegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Fall is our favorite season as it has variety of colors and outside temperature starts cooling down after the hot and humid summer. This year we decided to go for a road trip across the state of Colorado which is near from where we leave now (San Antonio Texas). Initially we decided to travel all the way by car but then decided to save some time and energy by Flying to Denver, Colorado from San Antonio, Texas. In this blog we tried to give you a very brief but crisp idea about our trip to Colorado which will help you in planning your trip.]]></shortDesc>

My mom makes this Sorshe bata diye Mach very often but I have never tried it with onion, ginger and garlic. One day I came across this Sorshe Salmon recipe of Somedutta's (my friday food swings) and it caught my attention. I gave it a try, wait ... not once but several times! The recipe is absolutely amazing, you can make this with any type of fish. Please do give it a try.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Fish paturi aka Macher Paturi is a traditional Bengali recipe in which any white fish fillet (bhetki or swai or basa is preferable) or shrimp or Hilsa is cooked by wrapping in banana leaf. The word 'Paturi' comes from the Bengali word Pata or Leaf. Almost any Bengali function or good old Bengali restaurant is incomplete without Paturi. You can either steam them or fry them. But I like the fried version. You will need the freshest quality of fish for this recipe. Do try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Paneer Masala has a spicy onion and tomato based gravy with some flavorful spices like garam masala powder, dry fenugreek leaves etc. In any dhaba style (road side food joints) curry you will get actual flavors of the spices as they follow one simple rule - slow cooking. Fry the onion until golden, cook ginger garlic paste until raw smell gone, after adding dry spices cook on low flame and obviously you have to add ghee or butter. If you can follow these few simple things, then trust me you can achieve the exact taste of Dhaba style Paneer Masala. Do give this a try and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Bhapa Doi is an old school Bengali dessert recipe. Bhapa means Steamed and Doi means Yogurt. I wanted to do something new with this recipe and that is why for flavor I chose Coffee as Mango, Cardamom, Saffron are very common flavors whenever we think about Indian desserts. In this Bhapa Doi recipe Coffee can be overpowering, it can make the yogurt bitter in taste, so first add little, taste, if you need more then only add another teaspoon. My family calls this yogurt Bengali Cheesecake as it comes out very thick and creamy, I hope you will enjoy it's taste and flavor too.]]></shortDesc>

If you are not sure whether the yogurt will become thick or not, then grind half of any flavorless biscuit to a fine powder.</div><div>Then add this (1 Teaspoon) powder to the caramel milk, mix well and that to the main milk mixture.</div><div>Ground biscuit will absorb the extra moisture from yogurt and it will came out thick.</div><div>But do not add too much powder otherwise the texture of yogurt will become grainy.</div><img src="recipeimages/mishti-doi-2e3af38e-a02a-4ea3-a977-0133aa68deae.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/mishti-doi-25818665-6781-4c81-b38a-6b2d5fa9c7c2.jpg"  style='width:45%'/>]]></process>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Ras Malai is a very popular Indian dessert in which first we will make soft, spongy rasgullas then they will be soaked in flavored sweetened milk. It tastes so so good during summer. Always serve Rasmalai chilled. In Bengali it is called Roshomalai. You can obviously make Rasmalai with store bought Rasgulla to cut down the time and effort. Do try this recipe in your kitchen and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[After marriage during my stay in India, I was a fan of my MIL's Kanchkolar Chop. She used to make them at least once in a week in the evening. Anything batter fried or crumb coated is either Chop or Cutlet to Bengali, like Alur Chop, Mochar Chop, Enchorer Chop, Macher Chop. The taste of her Raw Banana Fritter was so much better than the street shop's ones. Adding chopped onion, coriander leaves and chaat masala is my addition. She used to make curry with left over Kanchkolar Chop. That also tastes yumm! Try this easy recipe in your kitchen and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

I served it with mishti pulao aka basonti pulao and the pair was heavenly. Do try this recipe and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

You can enjoy this preservative free Aam Kasundi all through the year. The aroma and taste of homemade Kasundi is phenomenal like any other Chutneys. I kept the recipe very simple and easy. You can not only serve this with deep fried food like Fish fry, Fish finger, Egg devil, all kinds of Pakora but also use it in Fish curry, Prawn curry or even Chicken recipes. During summer, Aam Kasundi is a must have and it uplifts the taste of so many simple things like 'saak bhaja' / stir fried greens. Try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Chanar Payesh is a traditional Bengali dessert recipe in which soft, crumbled panner will be cooked in semi thickened milk along with condensed milk and green cardamom. The texture of Chanar Payesh is very important - neither too thick nor too thin. In one word this Payesh tastes delicious and more over it is very easy to make. During summer, when you want to make some cold, lightly sweetened dessert for any occasion or party, then Chanar Payesh is the best option as it takes very less time to cook than other typical desserts.]]></shortDesc>

Mango is one of my favorite fruit with which you can make so many things like Yogurt, Ice cream, Phirni, Kheer, Cake, Cheesecake and what not. This season I made Mango Sondesh, taste and texture came out really good. You can make them with Ricotta cheese also, in that case add some milk powder as ricotta cheese is much thinner than Paneer. Mango pulp is going to give the Sandesh very refreshing and nice aroma. For color I have used saffron. Try this simple recipe in your kitchen and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

        <process><![CDATA[<div>Put 2 liters of milk in a saucepan, then turn on the gas on medium flame and keep stirring.</div><div>When the milk starts bubbling, reduce the flame to low and add beaten yogurt. Yogurt will leave large amount of paneer and also will make the chum chum soft. Turn off the flame and mix well.</div><div>After 1-2 minutes you will see the chena (paneer).</div><img src="recipeimages/malai-chum-chum-5c07d2db-0eb0-4733-98fb-82aa15979075.jpg" /><div>Immediately strain it in a strainer lined with a cotton cloth. Then wash it with cold water for few seconds. To get the spongy chena you have to do this 2 things quickly.</div><div>Squeeze the paneer with cloth gently 2-3 times with your hand, not more than that. Then hang it with kitchen tap for only 30 minutes. Do not make the paneer very dry.</div><div>In the meantime, mix 6 cups of water and 2 cups of sugar in a big, open vessel. Keep the vessel on medium flame and stir until sugar melts.</div><img src="recipeimages/malai-chum-chum-ddc0dd20-4b2d-40fe-9af1-7765d4fdf3a7.jpg" /><div>After 30 minutes take out the chena in a plate or flat surface.</div><div>First crumble the paneer gently with your hand, then lightly mash it with your fingers for 1-2 minutes.</div><img src="recipeimages/malai-chum-chum-098dcf9c-7d8b-4cb2-b666-948c2ee52216.jpg" /><div>Do not mash it hard, otherwise chom chom will become hard. You don't have to make the paneer very smooth.</div><div>Now make big lemon size balls out of it. Then start rolling them on a flat surface and give cylindrical shape. You will get 8-10 chom chom.</div><img src="recipeimages/malai-chum-chum-7b772321-559e-447d-94b9-cd6c69693100.jpg" /><div>Drop them in sugar syrup while it is bubbling. For the spongy texture you will need thin syrup. If you are making in a medium sized pot, then add 4 at a time.</div><div>Cover the pan, cook on high heat for 10 minutes. They will become double in size.</div><img src="recipeimages/malai-chum-chum-73b1275f-5e69-4d2a-b826-aded9f9c0a2d.jpg" /><div>Then reduce the heat to medium, flip them gently with spatula and again cook for 15 minutes.</div><div>Turn off the heat and let them cool down completely. Chom chom will shrink a bit when they will become cold.</div><div>In the meantime, heat another liter of milk in a separate pan.</div><div>Start stirring and boiling until it reduces to half.</div><div>Then add condensed milk and green cardamom. Mix well.</div><img src="recipeimages/malai-chum-chum-b85a8dc6-26da-447a-973e-781444ed52fe.jpg" /><div>Cook until milk becomes thick. Neither too thick or too thin.</div><div>Then turn off the heat and remove the cardamom pod.</div><div>Now put one chom chom inside of your two palm and lightly press it to squeeze extra syrup.</div><div>Do the same with rest of them.</div><img src="recipeimages/malai-chum-chum-8352d6f3-6f4a-4116-baf7-e6ab8dd03ff8.jpg" /><div>Now take out the malai in a flat pan or dish.</div><img src="recipeimages/malai-chum-chum-18a347a2-4c34-4225-86ac-1daa1ba4a0a3.jpg" /><div>Arrange the squeezed chom chom in malai.</div><img src="recipeimages/malai-chum-chum-0ddf61ae-43df-4e6a-8916-994048c9dfdd.jpg" /><div>With the help of a spoon coat them well with malai by rotating them carefully.</div><div>Keep them in refrigerator for atleast 4-5 hours.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I guess you all, who follow my blog, already know that we have a 'thing' for Biriyani. Be it with chicken / mutton / prawn we are always ready to enjoy. I've already posted Kolkata style biriyani recipe which is much easier than Hyderabadi style as you need to have full confidence on timing and proportions. In Kolkata we make the chicken with gravy first and then give 'dum' with cooked rice, whereas, in this case you have to spread cooked rice over the marinated raw meat and then give it 'dum' until the meat becomes perfectly cooked and also remain juicy enough - it's not easy as it sounds. After several trials I have achieved my confidence on making this biriyani and it's my pleasure to share the recipe + details with you. ]]></shortDesc>

Last weekend I had a party in my house. Among all the foods, the main attraction was Mutton Korma. Korma is very rich itself. Always serve this with light rice item or naan. Do give it a try and let me know how it turned out for you.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[If you have any Bengali friend in your gang then I guess you already know that he / she has a thing for fish, football and rabindra sangeet. We eat fish in many forms like thick curry (kaliya), thin curry (jhol), batter fried, shallow fried (mach vaja), steamed version (vapa) and so on. One of the popular among them is 'fried fish'. Now in this category also we have so many variations. The most simple one is shallow fried marinated (with salt and turmeric) fish and the complicated one is 'Fish Roll'. In this recipe fish fillets will be stuffed with spicy fish and shrimp filling then they will get a coating of breadcrumbs and at last deep fry them until golden ... it's the example of our ultimate love towards fish &#128522;&#128522; . The hard part is making the roll, except that step, everything is easy. The taste of fish roll is phenomenal. You just need to give one bite to understand it's deliciousness. ]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Niramish means without onion and garlic. Usually when we offer a meal to god / goddess with our respect and devotion, we call it 'Bhog' / 'prasad' . In any prasad, this Aloor Dom is a must with khichdi and chutney. This recipe is without onion and garlic, that's why I mentioned 'niramish'. During monsoon you can also enjoy this with khichuri, beguni and chutney or in weekend breakfast make some luchi / lachha paratha with this curry. Whenever you arrange your next puja in your home, don't forget to put this item in the menu. I have already posted some other 'dum aloo' recipe. Try this in your kitchen and you will love it.]]></shortDesc>

Now mix everything well with your hand or spoon, then keep it aside for 3 hours or for the best result keep it in the fridge for overnight.</div><div>For the dough, mix flour and some salt.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Mughlai Keema Paratha is a very famous street food 
which has another name Keema Baida Roti. In Kolkata we call them 'moglai porota'. I made these parathas exactly like street style with minced meat, but you can skip that Keema part and keep the rest of the recipe same. The process is a bit lengthy but it is worth trying. I made dry potato curry along with mughlai paratha because these two goes very well with each other. I learned the recipe from my mother-in-law. She used to make this at evening without keema and we all enjoyed those very much. Here is the recipe with step by step clicks. Try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turns out.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Koraishuti means green peas and Koraishutir Kochuri is not just a food, it is an emotion for a Bengali. According to me, winter is incomplete without 'green peas'. Am I right ?? We Bengalis love to eat 'koraishutir kochuri' during winter. In my home nobody brings this kochuri from shops. My mom always makes this at home with 'aloo dom' , 'payesh' and everybody loves it. Nowadays we don't need to wait till winter for green peas because now almost everywhere frozen peas are available. I very much enjoy the combination of asafoetida (hing), ginger and green peas. This kochuri goes very well with 'kashmiri dum aloo'. Try this in your kitchen and share some of your winter stories with me.]]></shortDesc>

This yummy starter can be enjoyed with a cup of tea or a glass of beer. Try this in your kitchen and spend some quality time with Egg Devil & your loved ones.]]></shortDesc>

Usually mutton handi is cooked in clay pots, that's where the name came from. But I didn't have one, so cooked in my regular vessel. The taste was out of the world, soft pieces of slow cooked mutton literally stole my heart. If you are a mutton lover, please give this recipe a try and you can thank me later.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[This dish dont need any explanation. Its very popular in India and nowadays all over the world. There was a rumor that without "tandoor/oven" you cannot make tandoori. But believe me today I am sharing "oven method and stove top method" of making tandoori chicken. 'Tandoor' means oven made with clay and the heat comes from charcoal. In restaurants the actual tandoor flavour comes when juices of chicken drops on the charcoal, it creat a nice smokey flavor. You will fall in love with those charred, spicy chicken legs. Please give this recipe a try at your home and prove the rumor wrong!]]></shortDesc>

Be it simple 'phuchka' (panipuri) or heaviest roll, I was always in ! Surprisingly after my marriage I have taken a lot of control over my food habit, I have become more conscious now. But that doesn't mean I can't eat fast food once in a week .. hell I can ! &#128516;&#128516; When I made these yummy 'egg chicken roll' last of last week (after a decade) there was simply no alternative to my happiness. I found the taste exactly like those shop's ones what I used to eat during college days.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Hariyali Chicken Kabab is a very delicious variety of kabab in which boneless chicken will be marinated in yogurt, ginger, garlic, mint-coriander paste and lot of fresh spices along with few other ingredients. You can definitely use chicken legs instead of boneless. I will recommend you to use chicken thighs instead of breast pieces, as thighs will come out much more juicy. Hariyali means green color. The mint coriander paste will provide a nice green color along with an unique flavor to this dish. I have served Hariyali Chicken Kabab with Butter and Saffron flavored rice and Salads. Enjoy the recipe with video.]]></shortDesc>

You can serve this Bengali style dry Potato curry with Luchi / Porota / Kochuri / Pulao / Fried rice and what not. It tastes heavenly. I made Lachha Parathas to go with it. The recipe of Aloor dom is very easy in which potatoes will be cooked in onion tomato based gravy along with a special ground masala and yes, this freshly made ground spice is the main key to create the authentic taste of Aloor Dom. In winter grocery market will be filled with baby potatoes, this recipe will become more attractive if you can use them.

They all are very very tasty. In Kolkata, one of the famous chaat is 'doi fuchka'. The hollow chips are filled with spicy potato filling, thick sweet and sour yogurt mixture, sweet tamarind chutney along with lots of fresh coriander leaves and few other ingredients. I have never made Chaat at home while staying in India because you can get them almost everywhere. But now that I am staying in USA, whenever I crave for Chaat, I had to make them at home. Trust me, after following this recipe you will achieve the exact same street style taste and flavors. Enjoy the video with detailed recipe. ]]></shortDesc>

In every street of Kolkata you can find various indo-chinese restaurants. I mentioned Kolkata style because they make this chilli chicken on a little bit of dry side and also extra spicy. You can also serve this as starter. Try this easy chilli chicken recipe in your kitchen and enjoy with your family.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Rajasthan is a state of India which is situated at the western part. In childhood I went there with my family on vacation, though I remember nothing much except our album photos. Rajasthan is the land of kings and 'laal maas', which is hot and spicy red colored mutton curry, is their well known dish. The dish is everything about color and flavors. They cook the mutton in a yogurt and onion based sauce with lots of chilies and garlicky flavor. The authentic Laal Maas recipe calls for 'mathania chilli' because they creat very nice red color with much less heat in gravy. Well, many of us don't have access to those chilies, so feel free to use kashmiri red chilies. Now, the recipe is very simple with loads of flavor, after all it's a mutton curry, it has to be delicious !]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I made this Kosha Chingri Macher Kalia last weekend with some steamed rice and curry leaves tempered musur daal. He finished the lunch (read there wasn't any meat curry, not even leftover) with a big smile, that too on weekend. This spicy prawn curry worked like a magic. So, I had to share with you all the recipe of this Bengali delicacy - kosha chingrir kalia. Though the word 'kosha' suggests slow cooking which we are not gonna do with prawns otherwise they will come out rubbery, but also suggests a dry (oily) and spicy gravy and in this recipe we will go with the second variety. Hope you will find the recipe interesting with the detailed video.]]></shortDesc>

        <process><![CDATA[<div><h2>What you need first? (before coming)</h2></div><div>1. Make sure you carry your passport & visa docs along with you in the first few days once you land in US.<br/></div><div>2. If you like home food you can buy some rice or daal (dry items) from nearby Indian store, do some research before coming to the city you are supposed to go. If absolutely no Indian store nearby bring 3-4 days supply with you.<br/></div><div>3. Bring some must have utensils like pressure cooker, karai etc those you can get here but might be expensive and hard to get within first week of arrival.<br/></div><div>4. Bring formals because they are costly and in some cases alteration or proper fitting might be a problem for you.<br/></div><div>5. If you are going in winter season bring one or 2 sweaters and one jacket, because you will find variety of options here.<br/></div><div>6. Book a hotel prior coming, preferably hotels like Extended Stay America where you will have a kitchen for cooking and they also provide utensils to cook.<br/></div><div>7. Ensure there is a target, walmart or Heb (in case of Texas) nearby the hotel so that you can get supplies.<br/></div><div><h2>What to do when I land in USA?</h2></div><div>1. Book supershuttle to commute from airport to hotel, their service is awesome and price is reasonable & staffs are great.<br/></div><div>2. Never take a private cab, they might charge you super high.<br/></div><div>3. Get a phone connection as soon as possible. Preffereably AT&T or T-mobile with good amount of data pack because thats needed for everything.<br/></div><div>4. For daily commute to work or school you can use Uber or Lyft or any other ride sharing apps. Research your city before finding an option online.<br/></div><div><h2>How to search for Apartment?</h2></div><div>1. Look for apartments near your work or suitable to your child's need (school).<br/></div><div>2. Here schools are tied to location and apartments are also tied to them so look for it while you search. (As I don't have the experience of that, I am not sharing anything, you might search in Google for that).<br/></div><div>3. If you are coming for the first time you won't have SSN (Social Security Number) yet so make sure when apply for apartments mention that, in that case you might need to provide high security deposit. Generally if your rent is $1200/month your deposit is less than that, may be it's $1000. (This may vary based upon location and Apartment complex's rule).<br/></div><div>4. While signing the lease you need to keep in mind following things: lease term/how long?, what is the lease breakage policy, connect electricity in your name, have a renters insurance, apply for Internet connection etc. your apartment complex's management will help you and guide you with that, they are very helpful.<br/></div><div>5. Make sure to check your apartment before signing lease, you need to look for your preferences and amenities such as washer & drier whether they are inside unit or you need to rent or pay for that or use the centralized laundry of the apartment, microwave is provided or not, gas is a payed or included, heating is included or not, means do you need to pay for that additionally etc etc.<br/></div><div><h2>Now I moved into Apartment, what to do now?</h2></div><div>1. Go to nearest Walmart or Target for basic required items such as Toilet curtain, door mats, if you are fond of white light search for it (they are called white light), kitchen utensils etc.<br/></div><div>2. Furniture can be purchased online or from stores like Walmart, Target (for Short Term stay), Costco, IKEA (for better options and long term stay as they have expensive items but last long as well)<br/></div><div>3. You can also buy furniture from stores like Goodwill, they sell used items at cheapest price.<br/></div><div>4. Always buy brand new mattress because there is a high possibility of having bed bugs or something like that if you buy used.<br/></div><div>5. You can order dining tables and chairs online, as well as sofa, bed frame & mattress. I would prefer online because they deliver at doorstep. There is no hassles of bringing that to your floor.<br/></div><div>6. Everything you need to assemble so its better to buy an automatic screwdriver which will save lot of your effort at the time of assembling the items you buy.<br/></div><div><h2>What to do in first few weeks?</h2></div><div>1. You must apply for Internet connection as soon as you move into the apartment.<br/></div><div>2. Open your bank account with the bank that is available in your state. Most of the states have Bank of America.<br/></div><div>3. After 2 weeks or so, look for the nearest SSN office and apply for your SSN. This will allow you to do almost all possible transactions and an unique record of your financial as well as all kind of transactions. This will be helpful for Tax purpose and all your future stay.<br/></div><div>4. Once you receive 2 address proof (apartment lease document) and another utility bill or bank statement (mailed to your apartment address, not online) you can apply for a driving license. Note: Check with DMV website for the documents required for applying the driving license before going to DMV.<br/></div><div>5. If your spouse doesn't want a driving license, you must apply for a state ID as that might be required for age, address & identity proof and it is accepted in domestic air travel and every where in US.</div><div><h2>Thats it, enjoy your trip</h2>Hope this article will help.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Every family has their own breakfast story. In Bengali households, 'luchi' is the common one. Sunday mornings are meant for 'luchi - torkari'.  I was never a breakfast loving person, still not. Actually for me the toughest thing is time management in the morning, always hullabaloo ! But my husband is a huge fan of 'luchi' or 'kochuri', so I have to make it once or twice in a week. I have already shared many types of 'kachori' recipe with you and now is the time for some Bengali style Poori. You can pair this with any veg / non veg curry and sweets, every time 'luchi' tastes delicious. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a perfect breakfast on any Sunday morning.]]></shortDesc>

There is no Bengali in the world who doesn't know about this dish ... yes, 'mutton ghugni' is that much famous. On special occasions or guest's arrival in evening, 'mangsher ghugni' is a very common item we Bengalis make. It's a Indian version of 'chili'. We make the curry of yellow peas with minced mutton .... delicious ! I kept the recipe very simple and easy. Try this awesome dish in your kitchen and enjoy a lovely evening with your loved ones.

If you get that chicken then it will be okay otherwise put the minced chicken in a blender and blend it for 2-3 times, it will become smooth.</div><div>Add salt, pepper powder and melted butter or oil in the chicken paste.</div><img src="recipeimages/chicken-momo-054a8137-a151-46d3-9057-48388e4f08bb.jpg" /><div>Next add chopped onion, ginger, garlic, green chilies, green onion, soy sauce and lemon juice.</div><img src="recipeimages/chicken-momo-701ed52d-07e3-4a6a-9265-cbed5fb3f794.jpg" /><div>You can add some MSG, if you want. Now mix everything well with your hand or spoon, then keep it aside for 3 hours or for the best result keep it in the fridge for overnight.</div><div>For the dough, mix flour and some salt. Then gradually add warm water and make a firm dough - neither very soft nor too hard.</div><div>Knead the dough well for 2 minutes then apply 1 Teaspoon of oil all over it.</div><img src="recipeimages/chicken-momo-2bb43f68-ef20-4755-bee0-10dfd28671fe.jpg" /><div>Cover it with a damp cloth for 30 minutes.</div><div>After that take a small portion from the dough.</div><div>With the help of some dry flour roll it to a thin round disc.</div><div>Place a round shaped bowl on it and cut 2 or 3 rounds.</div><img src="recipeimages/chicken-momo-b9bb7b14-67a7-4f96-96a9-58eeb928ea47.jpg" /><div>You will get perfect round and thin wrapper. Do the same with rest of the dough.</div><img src="recipeimages/chicken-momo-fc89c981-afb0-47e2-9795-0a0faa781996.jpg" /><div>Obviously you can individually roll very small balls one by one.</div><div>Place one wrapper on your palm. Then put a tbsp of chicken filling in the center of the wrapper. If you are a beginner then go with small amount of filling.</div><img src="recipeimages/chicken-momo-aa390cc5-98c2-4578-bc36-a36ee31b3269.jpg" /><div>Now is the tricky part. No, don't feel scared, making the plits is easy. After making 2-3 momos it will appear easier.</div><div>First make one pleat and then immediately pinch it with the other side. For better idea I will suggest you to watch the video.</div><img src="recipeimages/chicken-momo-e04dcf6e-20ab-49a6-8602-a1e33dc0b0e9.jpg" /><div>After making all the pleats, pinch the edges one more time to make it safe and secure. Make rest of them.</div><img src="recipeimages/chicken-momo-e3a702f1-4099-43f5-b11c-d8ec67e9ddd8.jpg" /><div>Heat 2-3 cups of water in a big vessel. Then place a steamer over it.</div><div>I didn't have any steamer so I bought an aluminium foil tray from store and make small holes with a chopstick.</div><div>Brush some oil all over the steamer.</div><img src="recipeimages/chicken-momo-417889c1-deae-4890-b5e4-63125189aa70.jpg" /><div>When the steam starts coming out, then arrange the momos. Do not overcrowd the steamer otherwise they will stick to each other.</div><img src="recipeimages/chicken-momo-f10cdb9b-aec1-407e-b64c-bb896e6ef1bd.jpg" /><div>Cover the steamer with a lid and steam them for 15-20 minutes.</div><div>Then open the lid and take the steamed momos out. Arrange another batch and again steam them.</div><img src="recipeimages/chicken-momo-534758bd-8f32-41d7-99b9-f7c766b7a590.jpg" /><div>I have already posted the smokey, hot and spicy chutney recipe to go with the momos.

When they serve this dish with raw onion chunks, green chilies and pickle, your appetite will increase to double for sure. From younger to elder, everyone is a fan of this dish.

On any occasion or just to enjoy some snacks, these chops were always bought from 'telebhajar dokan' / fast food center in my home. But in US, almost every Bengali knows how to make them. You can also make them in large quantity and then freeze them to enjoy afterwards. The recipe has no onion and no garlic, still yummy ...!]]></shortDesc>

This recipe is very, very exciting and creates exact taste of Dhabewali Aloo Palak. It is close to Palak Paneer recipe but slightly different and little low in calories.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[We all love to eat food from Dhaba (road side food joint) while traveling. Nowadays you can find many fake dhabas and taste of their food is also fake, nowhere close to the authentic ones. Luckily few old and original dhabas in India still sells the best meals. After tasting those foods, you will probably think that their cooks must have some kind of magical hands. I once tasted their 'mutton curry' .... a rich, creamy, flavourful gravy and juicy, succulent meat pieces. Last weekend I recreated the same dish in my kitchen and surprisingly he said it tastes exactly like that dhaba's mutton curry &#128515;&#128524;. The recipe is very simple and easy to follow. Do try it at your home and enjoy a great lunch with your family.]]></shortDesc>

He is a real foodie and have a very good knowledge about food and restaurants. So, I wanted to make something new on chicken for him and also for my blog. I have already posted 'mutton dopyaza' recipe, then I thought this time why not with chicken? Confirmed the idea with my hubby and 'chicken dopyaza' got selected for main-course along with 'mishti pulao'. They both gave me very positive reaction after finishing the dinner .... yaay &#128515; ! The recipe won't give you any stress, you can easily make them for big gatherings. If you are the host, then it's the perfect dish. The gravy is rich and very flavorful with juicy chicken pieces. 'Dopyaza' means you have to use double amount of onion - I used onion paste and cubed onion. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a delicious, fuss free dinner.]]></shortDesc>

Spicy crumbled fish inside and crispy coating outside - scrumptious !! We both usually enjoy this snack in the evening along with a cup of tea or with a can of beer. Both combos are unbeatable. If you have to impress any Bengali ever in your life, just indulge him/her in 'Bikeler adda' (evening gossip), 'a cup of tea', Macher chop' and 'Rabindra sangeet'.

From bachelor to elder, everybody knows how to make it. But this is a tastiest variation of khichdi. 'Achar' means pickle, I used mango pickle here. The process is very simple, no need to fry or cook anything separately, everything will be cooked in one pot and one time. I made this on lunch along with some chips and fried potatoes. The combo was phenomenal and we just loved them.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I fell in love with 'daal fry' when I first tasted it at a restaurant. A big bowl of daal fry with fresh aroma of coriander leaves and few slices of naan .. very simple equation to make me happy. Yes, you read it right .. no need of non veg stuff with this kind of blissful meal. In India, I never had daal fry at home, always in restaurant. But time flies so quickly. Now I can make it by myself. I didn't use onion and garlic as it was Tuesday, but you can definitely add them in oil while cooking. I have used only 'toor daal', you can use half 'masoor' and half 'toor' also. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a lovely dinner with your family.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[In Bengal, one of the common non-veg curry is 'chicken kosha'. I think everybody is familiar with this name. Kosha / Bhuna is a process where you have to cook the meat with spices on medium - low flame in its own juices, if it gets dry then only add water as less as possible. It requires time but with chicken you can make it within an hour. One can make the same curry with mutton, potato, egg etc. They all tastes really delicious. I maintained the recipe very simple and easy. Try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Fish fry or Bhetki fry is a very famous street food of West Bengal. Bhetki (or any white fish) will be first marinated in a green paste then they will get a coating of breadcrumbs and before serving will be fried until golden. There is a fast food center in Chandannagar, named 'robi fast food center', to me he is the best fish fry maker. As my school was in Chandannagar, so I know more shops of there than Chinsurah. There are actually two famous shops - 'bolai' is famous for 'chicken pokora' and 'robi' is famous for 'fish fry'. He always make them in front of you, deep fry them in hot oil and then serve those fries with salad and kasundi. Ohh, I miss those foods and fun a lot here. You will enjoy soft, flaky fish inside and crispy, crunchy coating outside, just heavenly. I brought that exact taste and flavor straight from his shop to my kitchen. Try this easy recipe in your kitchen and enjoy !!]]></shortDesc>

The Goddess Lakshmi is usually worshiped on the day of Sankranti. Every part of India celebrates the same festival with different name and food. According to Hindu Shashtra this day marks the termination of the Winter season and the beginning of a new harvest season. From childhood, I love this festival. My grandma and ma makes so many varities of sweet and savory food like 'pithe', 'dudh puli', 'bhaja pithe', 'soru chakli', 'ashke', 'patisapta', 'kholachi' etc with their love and affection. Each and every dish tastes delicious. 'Ros bora' is another sweet which we make on this special occasion. My father is a big fan of 'ros bora'. The dish needs a little effort but the end result will satisfy you. I made this sweet dish to celebrate 'makar sankranti'. Hope you will all enjoy this festival with lots of sweets.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[This green chili mutton has become very popular nowadays in Bengali restaurants in Kolkata. They make this dish with chicken also. After reading the ingredients you will wonder why spinach leaves? 6 blanched spinach leaves wont spoil the taste, rather it will give the curry a nice green color. Heat will only come from green chilies that's why there is no use of dry red chilies in this recipe. It's a delicious curry and best for summer days. Do try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[We, Bengalis, call them 'beguni'. Some people call them 'baingan bhajji'. There is no difference among the names. This is all about the tastiness and chrunchiness. You can get this fritter with some puffed rice and green chili in Bengal from any 'choper dokan'/fast food centers. When they serve this in 'thonga'/paper bag, the feel and look always increase my appetite a bit.
Khichuri - Beguni or Daal - Bhaat - Beguni ... which combo should I make for lunch ? as I have picked two very beautiful eggplants from grocery store and he was constantly pushing me to make Beguni. As it was Friday Bong Eats uploaded '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzfEnYxzjUg">Kancha Moong Daal</a>' recipe and I just found my answer. Thanks to them for such a simple, yet tasty Daal recipe which goes very well with some steamed rice and Beguni. ]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[We all love to eat chicken stew during summer days ... right ? Because it is very healthy and soothing for our body. I gave this recipe a twist with a simple Butter Garlic tempering and the taste turned out so yummy. As I am a garlic loving person, so I didn't use any whole spices like Garam masala here because the garlicky flavor would have been dominated by those strong flavors. Give this super easy recipe a try and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I have someone in my house who often demands to eat 'homemade-restaurant style' dinner in weekend ???. That's why last Sunday I had to make 'butter chicken' along with 'butter naan'. Nowadays 'butter chicken' is famous in all over the world. In Indian restaurants this is the mostly ordered dish. It has a tomato based, rich, velvety gravy and grilled, juicy chicken pieces. The combination was a total hit but you can also serve this with 'jeera rice', 'pulaao' or 'fried rice'. You can also make this dish with tandoori chicken, I have already post that recipe. Try this in your kitchen and serve a 'restaurant style dinner' to your family.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Chicken Bharta was prepared last weekend in our lunch. The recipe is Punjabi inspired Bengali dish. A very tasty shredded (pulled) chicken preparation which is famous throughout India. It has onion and tomato based gravy with beautiful flavor of kasuri methi and Garam masala. Of course, how can I forget about the Boiled Egg? To make an excellent Chicken Bharta you have to finish it off with boiled egg yolk. In Kolkata it's a frequently ordered dish in restaurants. To bring that exact flavor of restaurant I have used 'tandoori masala', believe me, do not skip this masala because it will definitely give the taste a big uplift. Chicken bharta goes very well with any rice preparation or naan, kulcha. But pair it with some naan or plain roti to enjoy it's authentic flavor.]]></shortDesc>

I'm going back to India next week, that's why for few days I've been very busy with packing and all, regular blog post is also not happening ... very sorry for that but I hope you will understand. In Austin, this 'basic chocolate cake' will be my last post because tomorrow we will disconnect our internet. While cleaning the kitchen last week, I found half box of cocoa powder, half box of wheat flour, 2 sticks of butter and more than half box of sugar. With these ingredients what can be better than a basic recipe of 'chocolate cake'? And chocolate is always an addiction! I made it and frosted the cake with a super easy chocolate frosting. That delicious cake was our dessert for 1 week. Do try this in your kitchen and my next post will come after settling down in India ... so be patient and happy cooking!]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I know it's been two weeks I didn't post anything due to settling down in India, but heyy now I am back with another interesting recipe from 'dhaba' gharana. Every place has their own style of dhaba / road side food joints. Whenever we plan any short trip within Bengal, we try to make the lunch stop at some popular Dhaba. Their 'torka-ruti' and 'chicken curry' with rice are must for us. I like their chicken curry on little bit of thicker side, whereas the thin curry also tastes awesome. I made this delicious dish last month and we both enjoyed it with chapatis. Do try this easy recipe in your kitchen and let me know how it turned out for you.  ]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Durga puja is just a few days away. Every street of Bengal and other parts of India will be filled with people and food stalls. Among all of them 'chaat' stalls are my favourite. I like various type of chaats like panipuri, dahi puri chat, papri chat, samosa chat, nimki chat, batata puri chat, ghugni chat and so on. Though today I am not sharing any Bengali chaat, but 'pav bhaji' is quite famous in Mumbai and many other parts of India. 'Bhaji' indicates spicy, tangy mashed vegetable curry and 'pav' means bread / bun. After having a plate of 'pav bhaji', don't ever forget to have a cup of milky tea ... trust me on this one. Before start cooking this dish, you have to remember one simple thing - Butter makes everything better ! Do try this recipe in your kitchen and enjoy a great evening with your family.]]></shortDesc>

Whenever I cook, specially without onion and garlic dishes, most of the time I end up adding capsicum into it ... i know it sounds stupid but surprisingly the taste becomes more yumm ! Today's recipe is about 'paneer rezala', a vegetarian mughlai delicacy, where paneer cubes are cooked in a nut based white gravy and in that my very own addition is some fried capsicum. I made this last week for the first time and it has become one of our favourite. You can enjoy this with biriyani, pulao or some steamed rice. Do try this at your home and let me know how it turned out for you.]]></shortDesc>

He is a crazy fan of fish and can eat it everyday, whereas, I don't like to eat 'macher jhol' / 'mach vaja' each and every day like him. I get bored very quickly.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Yesterday I experienced the worst ... my camera's memory card got corrupted and I lost more than half pictures of this recipe. We tried very hard to recover those photos but no luck!! It was nobody's fault, it's just that the tiny little piece of 'card' betrayed me &#128532;&#128532;&#128532; very harshly .. and I felt tremendously helpless towards 'technology'. Now you guys know why there is no step by step pictures in this recipe. Anyway, among all of this depression, the brightest side is the dish 'mangsher chop'. In Bengal, it is one of the popular and lip smacking snack which you can get in many fast food centers. Spicy, crumbly mutton filling inside and crispy coating outside. Here in Austin, it was pouring heavily from last 2 - 3 days and I couldn't find any better day than this to make those croquettes. You can pair them with a cup of tea or a can of beer, every-time they will taste better and better.]]></shortDesc>

Both of them are Bengali words. You can definitely make this dalna on any puja / vrat days as they are onion and garlic free.

Its the easiest, nicest and cheapest way to get into Chicago downtown. No problem of traffic jam or any other hassles.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-ce38e067-016a-47ba-b264-209c6d1a5b2b.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-17d44fbf-a943-4613-a900-7fc08db37023.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-bc5ecf42-182d-46ac-a16b-966c8748f146.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>We were tremendously hungry when we reached there downtown. So, tracked down a restaurant named '<a href="http://roti.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Roti Mediterranean Grill', this.href);">Roti Mediterranean Grill</a>' which was the nearest one from the Blueline train station. The place was fully  crowded and very similar to Chipotle.</div><div>We ordered 2 plates ($21) of rice bowl with chicken kebab, onion, hummus, tomato & cucumber, hot sauce and pita bread. Food was delicious. The rice was very flavorful and quantity was also pretty good. They have veg (falafel) option also.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-4c887cb8-df41-41ef-b55d-88b97b25f47b.jpg" /><div>After finishing our lunch we headed towards '<a href="http://www.artic.edu/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: The Art Institute of Chicago', this.href);">The Art Institute of Chicago</a>' and the famous 'Swami Vivekanand Way'.

Swamiji represented India and gave speech - 'Sisters and brothers of America ...', at the Parliament of religion which was occurred inside this famous building.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9c8c1e7f-7411-4088-9690-5d6adeafc9d0.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-5d79a527-bb0d-4912-89ee-cd4c5b485251.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-23523f92-0956-4de0-92f8-da4d7d596867.jpg" /><div>We also went to the Chicago River walk ... don't ever miss this walk, it is charming and wonderful. After that we looked at the clock and it was 2.00pm. So, decided to go to the hotel (<a href="http://www.doubletreemagmile.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Chicago - Magnificent Mile', this.href);">DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Chicago - Magnificent Mile</a>) as the check in time was 3.00pm and also we were tired. Our room ($181 per day) was on 20th floor. It was very clean as expected. The bed, towel, sofa, toilette were very impressive. Although you can't keep your personal drink in the fridge as it was filled with their expensive (!!) drinks, they should keep some empty spot for us so that we can keep our own stuffs, which is a bit awkward for us.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-12495fd7-0d29-4536-9636-20f7e48163e4.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-24274922-e12f-4ef4-b882-6ca43833cb86.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>After taking a short nap and freshen up, we went to the famous <a href="https://navypier.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Navy Pier of Chicago', this.href);">Navy Pier of Chicago</a>.</div><div class='videoIframeDiv'><div class="videoDiv"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2UVG48n83BQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><div>It is a beautiful place with splendid views and filled with life. We took an Chicago Architectural Boat Tour ($35 per person) which was 75 minutes long water journey into Chicago river.</div><div class='videoIframeDiv'><div class="videoDiv"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJsl1yWzB_Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><div>The boat covered almost the whole city and the tour guide gave very informative descriptions about the buildings of Chicago. As that afternoon was very hot, we got exhausted after an hour. So, I will recommend you to take this type of trip after 6 or 7pm in the summer days.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-252c9ce9-7a50-4cb1-b52d-afa450a7acf5.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-bb71c203-2972-48d3-9c7b-b3feaac486c3.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-cf66220e-ce04-4883-b7e6-84656284480c.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-f0f4575e-c477-4032-a1e6-e38de1ce9969.jpg" /><div>While the boat left us at the Navy Pier at the end of the trip, we bought an awesome looking ice cream cone and started our journey towards the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Water_Tower" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Chicago Water Tower', this.href);">Chicago Water Tower</a>. We took a bus, it took about 8 minutes to go there.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1d3fa4fa-8523-49d4-91a2-bf4652e5452f.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>The tower is located at North Michigan Avenue. It is the second oldest water tower in USA. The story says, this tower was the only building which survived the Chicago Fire and also it is one of the few surviving structures still standing. But it must be a place to visit if you are in Chicago.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-87e989a9-fddb-4683-907f-d470deab7f8b.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>While coming back from the water tower we suddenly tracked down an indian restaurant - '<a href="http://www.indiangardenchicago.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Indian Garden', this.href);">Indian Garden</a>' which was few foot steps away from our hotel. The ambience of that place was pretty decent and many tables were filled with people. We placed an order ($37) for - a chicken dum biriyani, a chicken korma and a butter naan.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-c4d2b134-bd20-4f2d-ab18-75ad21be7a0f.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-e7c52051-eb00-44f5-b31e-f7f141f123a6.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-6ca1ecf0-f4a6-4544-8dbf-1ebb65dccbb8.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1c798196-b3c6-4a8f-a2b6-599c80780e94.jpg" /><div>Well, the 'biriyani' was just a mixture of chicken curry and rice, you can see that from the pictures, it came with a 'raita' which was good. Korma was ok, there was no complementary rice with it! But their 'naan' was very soft and fresh. They also served 'papad' and 3 types of chutney as a complimentary starter which was really tasty. Overall food was totally overpriced.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d10e7bd5-023b-433b-935b-ee2a33670893.jpg" /><div>We started our next day with little breakfast ($8) from Dunkin Donuts, which was very close to our hotel - 1 egg n cheese croissant, 1 pack of hash browns, 1 vanilla chai and 1 frozen hot chocolate .... delicious !</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-de92b810-8a30-422a-a27e-291b4e977f3d.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d8e96630-7923-481e-9a64-a5628bcc6a24.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1105fd24-29bd-4eeb-bd42-e9017fdb3867.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>Our first destination was '<a href="http://theskydeck.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Willis Tower', this.href);">Willis Tower</a>' also called as Sears Towers. We took <a href="https://www.lyft.com/invite/AMITAVA488489" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Lyft', this.href);">Lyft</a> and got there within 10 minutes. It's 108 storied and the 2nd tallest building of USA. The famous sky-deck is located at 103rd floor of the tower. Elevators will take you there within quick time.  It is the most popular attraction point in Chicago. The view from that floor was marvelous. We spent 2 memorable hours within it.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-6ef87b76-5999-4ef4-a249-eb2cf1f8ff89.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-c1a38e21-4177-4de3-bd86-b89a2311b1c8.jpg" /><div class='videoIframeDiv'><div class="videoDiv"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HppFMPaasKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-431648f8-4a6e-4b57-8e22-dfa40044a257.jpg" /><div>Then our next stop was '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Fountain" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Buckingham Fountain', this.href);">Buckingham Fountain</a>' which is located at the '<a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/grant-park/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Grant Park', this.href);">Grant Park</a>'. The fountain is a landmark of Chicago. Many tourists and locals visit the fountain every day. It's one of the very beautiful place in Chicago. Water (light) shows occur from evening to night. We couldn't get the chance to see it as their gate was closed for a concert. But morning view was very refreshing and wonderful.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9a3d1522-afd3-4c91-a0f8-db35f634ca36.jpg" /><div>Another famous point is <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/millennium_park.html" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Millennium Park', this.href);">Millennium Park</a> walkable distance from Grant Park. We went there as well and it was just awesome.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-b89db16e-3e24-407e-b4f2-b5b7ef090e81.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-cc66c447-6885-4fc1-aa0c-33d4c91ce7bc.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1f3baf11-9574-420d-b895-aff285ef3cdd.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>Now it's time to reveal about that attraction without which Chicago trip remains incomplete - The Bean or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Gate" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Cloud_Gate', this.href);">Cloud Gate</a>. We all know, it was designed by an Indian artist - Anish Kapoor. The sculpture is named 'the bean' because of its shape, made with mercury and it reflects the city's beautiful skyline. The morning view was totally different from the night view. Both were very impressive.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-8c82b42e-c84d-4be6-9234-bd2a5ead9e9b.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-5b4b32bf-1a1b-4097-9487-e872c3cd09b6.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-0ce1ddba-8064-4662-ac48-425d10c6faab.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>After finishing these, we got very much tired and hungry. One of the legendary food item of Chicago is - Deep dish Pizza and we had it at <a href="http://www.unos.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Uno Pizza', this.href);">Uno Pizzeria & Grill: Uno Chicago Grill - Deep Dish Pizza</a>. Our server Phill was very helpful and decent. We ordered for a small (really enough for two of us) deep dish pizza with chicken, onion and jalapeños. It was delicious. They took 45 minutes to make it but the wait was totally worthy. The pizza was hot, fresh and very heavy. After that we wanted to taste Chicago style 'cheesecake', well it was nothing fancy, just like a very normal cheesecake. Overall our experience was very very good at this busiest restaurant.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9e4fe450-dd04-4b55-885c-f0508c241a0d.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-f34b462c-4358-403a-abef-0a5fb7622dba.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-8b04442d-cbc9-4b9a-8b4a-bc0b717c5d67.jpg" /><div>At the evening we again went at the Cloud Gate to see the evening view of The Bean. You can say from the pictures that it is wonderful and the place is very happening. The street was packed with traffic and we got late for our dinner.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d56ab2ad-e00f-4ebb-90c6-f2cab7dceb9f.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-12c794f5-e29b-494c-bc43-4df90c7ffd6d.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-0fda35b8-685a-4b02-ad05-d6063f3be9d1.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-0ad6c0f6-c8db-4ca2-a723-e6f106859648.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-b533459b-f8bd-4955-aa59-542d4a03d367.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>I eyed a spanish restaurant named 'Emilio's Tapas' from the first day which was very nearby from our hotel. So we got into an Lyft to get there quickly for our late night dinner. Ahh, the experience was awful. At first we placed 3 orders - a salad plate with duck breast, a casserole of chicken and a grilled calamari plate. The quantity of them were surprisingly less / tiny. Salad was good, my casserole was also ok, but calamari plate had a very burnt taste. Then we again placed order for a chicken item and they gave us beef. After that shamelessly they charged us $48 and the server was not even sorry for serving beef instead of Chicken ... what the hell !!</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-71edbc3c-01cd-47fb-83b0-b473a9496350.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-802d061a-8dc3-416e-b399-82130a5409ce.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-f8fcedbe-6478-4a46-82a6-40f6555f4c96.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9bcab44e-6b0d-4c58-8c0b-3c08581c0495.jpg" /><div>Next day we again had the same breakfast with a refreshing mango smoothie instead of hot chocolate. It was a very relaxing day for us, the sky was filled with clouds, breeze was lightly cold and we walked the entire day upon '<a href="https://www.themagnificentmile.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Magnificent Mile', this.href);">The Magnificent Mile</a>'. It's a famous road, packed with upscale shops and small size shopping malls.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-80524215-d7a2-4dbc-8cbb-74703f8ce293.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-5466b2cc-b3c1-47a3-9b5d-e7e348a4ba90.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-11c28525-2675-4e79-bf1d-ddf06cce3e63.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1d19cf75-e876-4c3a-ad4a-7c50799356b1.jpg" /><div>When there is a <a href="http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Cheesecake Factory', this.href);">Cheesecake Factory</a>, there is always a big smile you can find on 'his' face. He is a crazy fan of them. So, as usual we had our lunch ($42) there - Dynamic Shrimp, White Chicken Chili and Factory Chicken Nachos there. The batter fried shrimp was the star and you can never complain about their quantity. We loved the other 2 Mexican dishes too. Just mind blowing nothing to complain about.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-a542c88d-b463-461d-aa23-c221451167f9.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-3bfcae22-a8fa-4f01-9b08-fb5610d528f1.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d0186dd9-8932-4090-a029-ae4377b44eaf.jpg" /><div>After returning to the hotel, the rain started and the weather became more romantic. We went to the 'Navy Pier' again to enjoy the evening. And yeaahhh the decision was perfect. The sky became totally clear by then. We spent 4 long hours there and then had our dinner.</div><img src="recipeimages/we-at-chicago-fa72cd3d-548e-4f90-95ec-163b14822e13.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-22135803-9461-4f53-ab9d-f1c35613f9c1.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-542c6954-0309-4bad-aafd-6ee8633769b3.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-04fc371a-cf71-44f7-a665-7fc59a44d58e.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>There were plenty of restaurants filled with people. One of them was '<a href="http://www.dmkrestaurants.com/restaurants/fish-bar/" target="_blank" class="refLinksInternal" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: DMKs Fish Bar', this.href);">DMK's Fish Bar</a>'. We went there and our order was ($48) - 2 ginger ale, 1 spicy turkey burger, 1 crispy calamari and 1 fish and chips. Calamari was very good, topped with some cheese and pickled jalapeños. In my burger-  the bun was very soft, patty tasted good, just didn't like the cheese. The battered cod fish fillets were so crunchy and delicious. The thing we disliked was their french fries - they were very soggy, otherwise everything else was spot on.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-74d51f0a-6776-4dc5-aa7e-5f4c5ded9262.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-b17abf64-74b6-4cf5-8f83-05ccbf6b0d75.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-85a9b965-27ae-41bf-a2a7-6b83f442a261.jpg" /><div>This was the last day of our trip, we were leaving Chicago. Started with very light and yummy breakfast we brought previous day night from 711 - 1 marble cake and 2 bananas. Then checked out from the hotel and went to the airport. While reaching there we got an email that our flight is delayed for 1 hour ... bummer ! After the security check, we had lunch - chicken shawarma, spicy chicken burger with fries from 'Gold Coast Dogs'. My shawarma was good, french fries were very crunchy, but his burger was no at all spicy.</div><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-7919a733-874d-4eba-9dc2-8ae4c939cb81.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-a63d4d48-dfe0-496e-812f-d3d1509b4463.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-3e0dbec5-f814-4b0d-a9b1-b8892f3a01e6.jpg" /><div>After waiting for 1 hour they again announced for another 3 hours delay due to bad weather.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Hey folks! I am back with another travel blog and obviously with a delicious food story from our recent trip to Chicago. During summer this city is full of fun! There are so many outdoor activities you can do, even with children. The streets were filled with people, road were badly crowded with bumper to bumper traffic, afternoon were real hot but overall the windy city has its own charm. I listed the name of every places and restaurants that we visited and enjoyed during our stay. It was 3 nights & 4 days trip and our experience was very good. If you don't have any plan for the summer, then just buy tickets and visit Chicago ... you and your children will have so much more fun there.  ]]></shortDesc>

You can get such url at very low cost from various domain providers. You need to choose a name and then book a relevant URL from any domain providers. We bought our domain very cheap, it costs around Rs 2000 for 5 years.</div><div><b>Point to Your Server</b> Once you get your domain you can configure that to point to the place where your code or web application is present, you can host it in github (for static web pages) or it can be hosted in any cloud provided application / web servers based upon your requirements. Once you login into your domain (from where you purchased) you can configure and point the URL to the server where your application is deployed just by specifying the IP address. Its easy, simple and quick process.</div><div><b><u>Responsive Web Design (RWD)</u></b></div><div><b>What is responsive web design?</b> The web design that fits to any kind of devices based upon the device capability. Be it desktop/laptop/mobile device or table the website display fits without distortion. And it looks good and user feels that the UI/UX is meant for the device.<br/>Choose your tool or use custom code to write your blog/website. You can use javascript libraries such as bootstrap to build responsive design if you are building your own website.<br/>Google provide mobile friendly checking facility where a webpage can be checked whether that is mobile friendly or not.

HTML pages must meet the W3C standards. 100% valid and error free the web site allow you to get proper weights in the SEO which means its not accessible as well as not search friendly.

Try to avoid this scenario.</li><li>Dynamic parameterization in the URL is not recommended until they are absolutely needed. And based upon that if your are changing page content that's not good as well.</li><li>Shorter and meaningful page URLs are recommended.</li><li>If both page URL and Page Title are same then its highly searchable.</li><li>Do not include stop words in the Page URL or in Page title.</li><li>Less folder nesting in the URL is recommended.</li><li>Case mixing in the URL is not a good option, try to use all lower case.</li><li>Repetition of same word in the URL is not recommended.</li></ul></div><img src="recipeimages/web-hosting-essentials-00783934-1332-4baf-8da3-5d0b67a125c1.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div><b>HTML Structure/Design</b> Some high level HTML design points are mentioned here. You can always search in web for more details related to the topic. <br/><ul><li>Each page must have unique page title.</li><li>All the web page title should be same as H1 tag of the page to gain more weight in SEO.</li><li>All Images in the website must have proper ALT tag which describes the image and also add title tags.</li><li>Inside body tag use proper nested HTML structure.</li></ul></div><img src="recipeimages/web-hosting-essentials-8198d354-2371-4b14-b02b-5551f343258c.jpg"  style='width:75%'/><div><b><u>Performance Improvement Considerations</u></b></div><div>Its always a challenge to load quickly and support concurrent users for any web applications. Some quick things you can do without investing lot of time and effort.<br/><ul><li>For javascript and CSS files user compressor such as YUI Compressor which helps minifying those files (basically convert them into optimum file with a single line, less size). This helps those to load quickly and also puts a factor of security for your Javascript code that way those codes are not readable by blank eye.</li><li>Use Content Delivery Network (CDN) which allows your static assets such as images, CSS and JavaScripts to be delivered from outside your server infrastructure. This is kind of cloud server near your physical location which servers those files for better performance.</li><li>User max of 2 to 3 types of Fonts in the webpage and try not to use custom fonts those needs to be loaded from third party source or from your own server because that will slowdown your overall performance.</li><li>Images must be web ready (72 to 96dpi), not in high DPI or printable formats.</li><li>Keep monitoring your page speed in regular intervals via browser plugins for free such as Google Chrome developer console. And fix problems as and when you notice them.</li><li>Do not use inline style or JavaScript instead try to put all JavaScript and CSS into a single file each of them.</li></ul></div><div><b><u>Meta Tags in Web Page</u></b></div><div>All webpage must have the following meta tags that way its easy for search engines to index them and store their information in proper format.</div><img src="recipeimages/web-hosting-essentials-a337166a-e94f-4fe2-ab03-da191444b36b.jpg"  style='width:75%'/><div><b><u>Setting up Google Analytics</u></b></div><div>Google Analytics account setup is a must for any website or blog this allows you to track lot of information, generate reports such as page views, country/city where you website is accessed the most, devices those are used the most, from where most of the traffic is coming to your website. Its easy to setup and free, you just need to register to Google Analytics using your google/gmail email address and few easy understandable steps. Thats it.

I was looking for something when we moved to Austin, TX from Edison, NJ as I was feeling so alone as there are no good friends around. So kind of nagging everyday to him, then he told me "why not you start a cooking recipe blog?" I will not be selfish here, I am also interested about food and cooking, so quickly 'buy in' the idea. Now "he" wants to use his web designing knowledge to build a custom blog instead of using any open source tools. We are going to explain high level about the website launching and best practices.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA['Chop - Cutlet' shops are very much available in Kolkata. You will surely find one or two shop in every street. You know how much I love fried stuff, but this one sits on top of my favourite list. 'Cutlet' means breadcrumb coated fried flat croquette. Generally in India we eat this type of fast food from street shop. After my marriage my mom twice made these chicken cutlets at home. They were scrumptious and the taste was exactly like street shop's. I got the recipe from her and tried my hand on them last friday. Oh boy, they came out just perfect ! The recipe is not at all hard, it's very easy and quick. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy with your family.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Earlier I have shared the recipe of 'Kolhapuri Egg curry', today I am going to share the same recipe, but with chicken and some changes. One of the main ingredient in Maharashtrian cuisine is 'coconut'. We both are not too much coconut eater but when it comes to make authentic dish, I always try to make the taste as close as possible. As this is a 'Kolhapuri' gravy, you have to incorporate coconut. I didn't have fresh one that's why I used dried one. We both found the taste and flavour of the dish extremely delicious. The spicy gravy with sweet coconut flavour and juicy chicken pieces will take you to another world. Try this easy recipe in your kitchen and enjoy a lovely dinner with your family.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[In USA, every Indian resturant serves 'chicken tikka masala' and it tastes delicious. I never had it in India, don't know why ? Tikka sized grilled chicken, onion and bell peppers are cooked in a tomato based creamy gravy. After tasting this dish several times in restaurants, last month I thought of making it at home. Few months ago I uploaded the recipe of '<a href="chicken-tikka-kebab.html">chicken tikka kabab</a>', so I am going to use that tikka spice powder in this dish. If you don't have the recipe, click the name and check it out. Try this easy and simple recipe in your kitchen and enjoy it with some butter naan and salads ...]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA['Rezala' is as we all know white, creamy, velvety gravy. In restaurants chicken or mutton rezala are very popular, goes best with Rumali roti. Here is the recipe of mouth watering 'fish rezala' which I ate one of my sister's wedding. There were plenty of delicious items in buffet but 'fish rezala' was the most crowded stall. That was really finger licking good. Always serve Fish Rezala with plain steamed rice. Recipe is the same as usual 'rezala' type, I just made it with fish. Try this in your own kitchen and let me know how it turns out.]]></shortDesc>

        <process><![CDATA[<div>As usual for us a long weekend means a break from work and travel somewhere, explore some food or visit some place famous. As we have something coming up at the end of this month (we will love to keep that secret), so we decided to roam around the city. The day 1 starts lazily and we were not able to decide where are we heading to?? Finally decided to visit Downtown Austin.</div><img src="recipeimages/second-bar-kitchen-76d13a4a-22cc-4952-b035-ccad1287fa3d.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>We took our favorite Capital Metro Bus from Tech Ridge Bay I towards Republic Square Station (SB) around 11:50AM and it took about 50 minutes (cheap ride for both of us in the express bus a day pass costs $7) for us to reach there. Once we get down from the bus it gave a different feeling when we see lot of people roaming around the city, walking & biking. We started to walk towards the river and we opted to go to "Second Bar & Kitchen" for our lunch (that was the intension of visiting Downtown). I (Amitava) went there earlier but she (no need to mention I guess !!!) haven't so we decided to go there together this time.</div><img src="recipeimages/second-bar-kitchen-333dcd59-07ce-4006-9573-cf5ef5f46037.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div>Its a nice place with welcoming people. We ordered Fried pickles as starter with a Ginger Beer for her and a mild Beer for me. What to say the pickle was AWESOME!!!</div><img src="recipeimages/second-bar-kitchen-c4668f2c-1602-4464-8f57-41c5ea5e8bfd.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/second-bar-kitchen-b93d2ae2-b4dc-40b1-afce-2818698501dd.jpg" /><div>After those, its time for some more food, so we ordered Congress burger (medium rare pork, $18) ... with truffle fries and Fried chicken and biscuit ($12). Both are equally awesome. The meat was tender soft and taste has a WAO!! factor in it.</div><img src="recipeimages/second-bar-kitchen-1851fc13-e139-458b-80f8-9de0e1a98f78.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/second-bar-kitchen-f56b7c88-575e-40b1-9bb8-c5ac4ade1649.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/second-bar-kitchen-3853e03b-4c61-4d6a-85ce-c0359c0eb0d4.jpg" /><div>Although overall the price looks a bit at the higher end with respect to the quantity but the quality, behavior of staffs were awesome. Its a well YES and a must go place if you are from or around Austin or visiting the city. We will love to go back to this place.</div><img src="recipeimages/second-bar-kitchen-fe3e6bc6-dc38-4265-87be-c005557c4d77.jpg" /><div>As you might know the temperature is around 96 - 98 degree Fahrenheit, so no more roaming around the city. We took a little walk for 10 - 15 minutes around the downtown and then take a bus towards The Domain Stores. We spent about 2 hours there, she had a popsicle stick and I take a cold iced mocha from Starbucks. The after roaming around some stores came back home. While coming back we took <a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Fasten', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://fasten.com/r/QP8701">Fasten</a> ride share for the first time (as Uber and Lyft left Austin) it was also a nice experience.

Its the wood burning smell with the aroma of meat and BBQ sauce.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-7dc35ce7-b1e0-4361-bba4-c6c8eb3d9844.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-14e7acfa-8f2b-4ec2-b508-5cf64e6f121b.jpg" /><div>At the time of checkin they gave a nice pager which glows with red LED and vibrates once our wait time comes to an end. We returned the pager and they took us into one of the wooden building and placed us in table.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-15b0ef3d-2ba8-45ab-ae67-efbf21e5bafb.jpg" /><div>While entering the building we noticed the Indoor Pit which is a massive one and can hold lot of meat inside. We saw some finest chefs are busy cutting meats and platting them with various sides and garnishments. The place was fully crowded and by looking at the face of the guests it seems everyone was equally excited and enjoying the food.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-bf6352a7-be23-40ca-925a-fdba6ce3c30a.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-d5ee94de-2eac-4368-955b-f37791b9e0eb.jpg" /><div>Now its time to order, we were a bit confused what to order (<a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Salt Lick Menu', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://saltlickbbq.com/driftwood-menu/">Full Menu</a>) but then decided to touch everything. The menu was excellent and we choose things from "MEAT BY THE POUND" section and ordered, 1/2 lb BRISKET $10.95), 1/2 lb PORK RIBS ($6.95), 1/2 lb SAUSAGE ($5.95), HALF CHICKEN ($6.95), ONE DOUBLE CUT BEEF RIB ($12.95) we also include the awesome soft bread and a bowel of smashed potatoes which reminds bengali style "alu bhate" which has potato and onion smashed together.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-c8d8f146-be0b-4599-816f-0c70b6ef91e4.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-f5d6338f-b7af-4f0b-b65b-83e515837682.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-7155b53f-e05a-433b-adde-1f0bce316240.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-692bf462-8bde-4472-9b29-2244c078f5fb.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-f6bd8383-e0ea-4b1d-bbd5-6d8d53358a5f.jpg" /><div>It took about 15 - 20 minutes for the food to appear, and once it's served all 3 of us just pounced on it and started digging. It was tasty, well cooked, sauces are added in proper proportion nothing is too much or too less. In one word just AWESOME!!!! We ordered a desert which we don't like a lot but liked the ice cream on top of it. Overall experience was awesome and fantastic.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-00c94c36-5422-4b65-a996-7f45c5b4b429.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-ae82ee64-bcdd-4fb9-839c-0ab6aa007683.jpg" /><div>After such a nice food, if you want you can enjoy the live music which is happening right at the spot outside the eating area where you can sit, relax, bring your own beer or buy wine form the local vineyard beside the place. Over all it was nice experience and now its time to head back to Austin, on the way we make a quick stop at "Radha Madhav Dham" spent about 20 minutes inside the temple, we liked the calmness and the ambience of the temple.</div><img src="recipeimages/texas-bbq-experience-cd343da3-9737-42a3-aaa3-fb49b0c5442b.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div><div><div><span>Useful Links</span><a class="refLinks" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Salt Lick Menu', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://saltlickbbq.com/driftwood-menu/">Salt Lick BBQ Full Menu</a><a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Salt Lick Menu', this.href);" target="_blank" class="refLinks" rel="nofollow" href="http://radhamadhavdham.org/">Radha Madhav Dham</a></div></div></div>]]></process>

We decided to use this 4th July long weekend to taste that. And once again it's Subhodip, our friend who found one of the best spot around the city. We truly enjoyed the BBQ.

        <process><![CDATA[<div><b>Journey Started on January 29, 2016</b><br/>We started our journey from Austin at 11:15AM by Mega Bus and reached to the destination at sharp 3PM. As it was winter, I wouldn't say that scenic view during road journey was good because most of the trees were leafless. Anyway, after reaching there we first went towards our hotel 'The Adolphus' and checked in there. The hotel was at downtown and interior was 80's. The decoration will give you a nice feeling and our room was pretty good. We got little tired after the journey, so, took rest for an hour.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-f5c253f9-1852-4116-a349-5ced86f63aee.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-42e876f5-91cd-4963-b505-fbfd6c8a04c3.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-cdc5f407-4675-40bc-bd73-a046d2031027.jpg" /><div><b><u>Attractions</u></b><br/></div><div><b>The Old Red Museum (01/29/2016)</b><br/>was our first stop after we got out from hotel and walked a little bit towards south on Commerce Street, it was 8 to 10 minutes of walk from our hotel. Old Red Museum or Dallas County Courthouse is also known as Old Red Courthouse. The building is made of red sandstone with marble accents. It is a historic government building. We loved the color and texture of the building. From the opposite side of the street, the view of this building was amazing. That was a busy street with little park and fountains.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-ec7ea3b9-ff2a-437e-b47d-f22db997fd58.jpg" /><div><b>The Sixth Floor Museum at Deplay Plaza (01/29/2016)</b><br/> is our next destination which is few foot step away from Old Red Museum. This building is one of the historic landmark of Dallas and USA. The plaza was typically visited by tourists now-a-days. Since 1989 more than six million people visited this plaza. The building has its own significance because of president John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. The museum is located at 6th Floor of the Texas School Book Depository building.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-29acae94-60f9-4c7c-abf2-6704e07a09a5.jpg" /><div><b>Arboretum and Botanical Garden (01/30/2016)</b><br/>is a great place to start day two. We like nature and flowers so this place is the dream place for us. 66 acers of land with lot of flowers, trees and White Rock lake made this place a great tourist destination. We saw lot of families with their kids enjoying the sunny day. We started around 9:30AM from hotel and reached around 10AM, as the public transport is good so we thought of coming here by bus (#060), which takes about 30 minutes (took $5 for both of us). They charged $5 each for the entry fee. We spent around 2 hours in this place and took lot of photos of various kinds of winter flowers and obviously both me and my hubby posed for some awesome pics. We have seen lot of squirrels and captured their activities. We decided to have our lunch at downtown so took the same bus back to downtown.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-b1154edd-3c04-4d5b-819f-81130c9e1954.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-254d6894-300d-4a09-acde-42c010b5cab0.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-50360c4c-c8fd-40ed-a264-4ba4542b166c.jpg"  style='width:85%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-af0161de-a3c6-4adc-a4f9-ddc1a03c6026.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div><b>Downtown Dallas (01/30/2016)</b><br/>has lot of exciting things to see, so we started with Thanks-Giving Square, it's a nice place and as usual we started clicking pics. Now time to walk towards the Dallas Museum of Art and just beside that the most happening place 'Klyde Warren Park' a place with food trucks but we just had our lunch so we couldn't enjoy the food. Lot of kids were playing in water as its a pretty hot day and we feel this place a little over crowded but a place to relax, sit and enjoy with family at the heart of downtown. We spent about an hour and now its time to head back to our hotel.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-87327f3a-37d4-4a8f-958e-4d83091dc3a8.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-4af722b8-6822-457b-92b8-e4a1ccea9cd8.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-f7f3454f-1ae9-4311-b036-f29bd876589c.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-64ec6d67-59a2-493d-a5b2-0cdb92b1bf19.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-e9822977-3804-467b-829a-fce9b52993e9.jpg" /><div><b><u>Time to Taste Food</u></b><br/></div><div><b>City Tavern (01/29/2016)</b><br/>was our first stop for dinner. It's basically a local bar and restaurant with downtown charm. The staff welcomed us and took order from us although it was a self-serviced restaurant. As we were not in mood of drinking, so we ordered Fish and Chips and Chicken Quesadilla with coke. They took 15-20 minutes to arrive. We are a big fan of 'fish and chips' and they served three fresh pieces of deep fried beer-battered cod fillets over loads of uniquely crunchy french fries with mayonnaise and mint sauce. In Austin almost every restaurant serves 'chicken quesadilla' and we tasted them so many times. In 'City Tavern' they grilled the tortillas with stuffing like cooked chicken, vegetables and cheese then served them with salsa sauce and sour cream. I love their taste and also impressed about it's quantity as I ordered from appetizer section. Overall, we were impressed by the polite, friendly nature of the staff and their food. The costs ($21) was pretty much reasonable as well.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-ddcb0c1f-3a87-4959-8a16-14ce68abc67b.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-51b4a27f-fab3-4ca8-bb97-671ecf05e6a6.jpg" /><div><b>Press Box Grill (01/30/2016)</b><br/>our lunch stop after botanical garden. The restaurant was in a busy street, filled with people. But the staffs were very manageable and friendly. We ordered 'Blackened Salmon with rice and grilled veggies' and 'Buffalo chicken Burger' with coke. They served the food within 25 minutes. In the first dish, a medium size fresh salmon patty, some vegetables were grilled and paired with flavorful rice. Well, in the burger boneless chicken was sautéed with spicy buffalo sauce, topped with blue cheese and came with lots of crunchy fries. We enjoyed the food and ambience. Though we were pretty full, but couldn't resist ourselves from having 'Tiramisu Torte' as dessert. Oh boy, the cake was layered, creamy, soft, and less sweet, perfect for us. We left the place after having $48 lunch and with satisfied heart and smiley face.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-72146840-8451-49d8-bdbb-704ece5b5401.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-a9109dc8-6d92-434a-b373-fb1249060684.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-ed786ab2-6c52-448a-9c9f-5d7255d9254d.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-ab29ab01-2d25-4461-8eb6-120f31419958.jpg" /><div><b>Wing Bucket (01/30/2016)</b><br/>was on the route towards 'old red museum'. I eyed that restaurant from the first day and went there on last day for dinner. Outside as well as inside were fully crowded with loads of wings on each table. After seeing them, we also felt greedy and placed order for 'chicken wings' in 'honey chipotle and margarita chile' sauce and 'fried chicken sandwich' with fries and coke. They offer 19 levels of spice for the chicken wings, can you imagine!!! After 15 minutes the food was served. We started tasting wings, well first 5 minutes were decent, but after that our hands became totally messy with tasty sauces. Then, we noticed it was not only we, every people in that restaurant was in the same condition!! Our sandwich was filled with crispy and saucy boneless chicken strips and was paired with french fries which was dusted with chili powder and salt. We loved each and everything from our $30 order and felt lucky that we didn't miss this one particularly among all others.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-3d5d76be-974f-4fd3-b15c-592defe44b3c.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-973c114d-eeef-4fc2-9394-e23199a9600c.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-5aa87bd3-cf94-4ca7-848d-65222f31e3b7.jpg" /><div>Its the last day or our trip, so we packed everything and checked out from the hotel around 9AM. Its time for a coffee, so looking for a Starbucks but where is it!!! All Starbucks are inside office buildings and as its sunday all are closed, Ahhh!!! We took a coffee from 7-Eleven and a water bottle for our 3 and half hour journey back to Austin.</div><div>Having a coffee in hand and walking towards the bus stop in the morning time reminded us the days of Kolkata. Its was a short trip we bring back lot of good memories with us and now its time to say Bye bye Dallas ...</div><div class='videoIframeDiv'><div class="videoDiv"><iframe style="border:none;margin:0px auto;display: block;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLpz-sGODMf5pYuFpj2kinbhjFX1OcqBDb" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><div><div class="travel-section boxArea"><div class="boxAreaInner"><a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: The Old Red Museum', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="refLinks" href="http://www.oldred.org">The Old Red Museum</a><a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: The Sixth Floor Museum at Deplay Plaza', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="refLinks" href="http://www.jfk.org">The Sixth Floor Museum at Deplay Plaza</a><a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Arboretum and Botanical Garden', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="refLinks" href="http://www.dallasarboretum.org">Arboretum and Botanical Garden</a><a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Thanks-Giving Square', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="refLinks" href="http://www.thanksgiving.org">Thanks-Giving Square</a><a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Klyde Warren Park', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="refLinks" href="http://www.klydewarrenpark.org">Klyde Warren Park</a><a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Dallas Museum of Art', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="refLinks" href="https://www.dma.org">Dallas Museum of Art</a><a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: City Tavern', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="refLinks" href="http://citytaverndowntown.com">City Tavern</a><a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Press Box Grill', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="refLinks" href="http://www.pressboxgrill.com">Press Box Grill</a><a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Wing Bucket', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="refLinks" href="http://www.wingbucket.com">Wing Bucket</a><a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Mega Bus USA', this.href);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="refLinks" href="http://us.megabus.com">Mega Bus USA</a></div></div></div>]]></process>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I am a homemaker and a food blogger. Both my husband and me love to eat different food as well as travel various US cities. I was planning to share our travel and food experience with you.
Presently we are staying at Austin and our last trip was to California on June, 2015. You can think of how much bore we were for not going outside Austin for past 7 months. We celebrated 'Durga Puja', 'Christmas', 'New Year' in Austin but something was missing!!! So, I took the initiative and planned a very short trip to the nearest city, Dallas. We both wanted some relaxation and refreshment. Did we get that in Dallas?? WoW, yeaahhh... 
We visited the historic Texas city with lot of cultural heritages and true history of the state. Today I am sharing our experience of Dallas with you. As this is my first travel blog so please let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[After scorching heat of summer, first few days of monsoon are my favourite. In those days I don't like to stand in front of the gas for long time, because in the meantime you can enjoy the rain by sitting beside the window. I think you guys have already guessed that I am talking about one pot meal - they are so easy to cook. One of the famous one pot meal in Bengal is 'khichuri' / khichdi. I have posted several recipes on khichdi but 'bhoger khichuri' is the basic one. You can make this simple khichdi on 'puja' / vrat days as they are onion and garlic free. Don't expect this dish to be very rich or spicy, but to be very ordinary with full of taste. ]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA['Keema Aloo' is my favourite curry when it comes to a fuss free but yummy dinner. It's so rich and spicy that there is no other meat curry which you can make in such a less time. I used mutton keema but feel free to use chicken mince. After adding the cubed potatoes, this dish becomes a killer ! Serve this with plain rice or paratha, every time 'keema aloo' will be a hit. It is also a very good maincourse option for big party or any get together. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy.]]></shortDesc>

Because almost every blogger has their own regional recipe of 'panipuri / golgappa'. But it's better late than never. In Kolkata I never eat 'phuchka' with sweet chutney, always with tangy tamarind water &#128521; and believe me there is no fun of having them sweet, the taste has to be spicy and tangy. 'Phuchka' is nothing but hollow chips with spicy potato mixture in the center and then filled with tangy water. So, so, so good and tastes million bucks ! Every single description will be short in comparison to a plate of 'phuchka'. As I used store bought chips, so, I am sharing only the recipe of potato filling and tangy water. Try this any day in your kitchen and enjoy a great evening with your family.]]></shortDesc>

We both thoroughly enjoyed the spicy onion filling inside those soft parathas. You can make 5 parathas with these proportions and serve them with pickles, raita or veg / non veg curry. These parathas can also be served in lunch box. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a peaceful breakfast with your family.]]></shortDesc>

Summer or winter doesn't matter ... weekend evenings are meant for some awesome starters ! After few trials I finally created the exact taste of Kolkata's one of the famous street food - 'kobiraji cutlet'. Kobiraji means coverage or lace like texture, which you can create with beaten egg. I know they are not at all healthy but they tastes insanely delicious. So, my advice - don't avoid them but eat once in three months &#128521;. I used minced mutton for this dish, you can also use minced chicken or fish fillets. Everytime you will fall in love with them after the first bite, believe me. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a lovely evening with your loved ones.]]></shortDesc>

The recipe is very similar to chicken manchurian (which I have already posted), except the key ingredient here is cauliflower, not chicken. You can make this dish with potatoes, soya granules or raw jackfruit also. Every single time it tastes delicious and goes best with fried rice or rumali roti. I made mine on dry side, but if you want this on gravy side, just add more water or vegetable stock. Both of them tastes incredible and you can serve them as starter or as maincourse also. Try this very easy recipe in your kitchen and let me know how it turns out for you.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Though I ate various types of kabab in India but had no clue about 'chicken shawarma'. I tasted this delicious dish first time in Austin, Texas and now they are available in pretty much all over the world. Shawarma' is a middle eastern kabab preparation which can be made of lamb / chicken / turkey or beef. I had them first time with pilaf and second time with pita bread. My husband and I both fell in love with the second version and tried so many of them from different restaurants. Professionally 'shawarma' is made by stacking the seasoned meat on a spit and then roasted slowly in front of a flame for hours. At home we can't get that facility .. so don't worry, make them on tawa or flat pan and enjoy the same taste and texture of 'shawarma'.]]></shortDesc>

You can never match the taste of tea stall's food with big restaurant's food ... a huge difference !  One of the famous item of those stalls in India is 'toast'. You can get so many types of toast from them like 'butter toast', 'french toast', 'plain toast' etc. I love to eat 'dim pauruti' or in fancy words 'savory french toast' as snack with some ketchup. I used to take these toasts in my lunch box also. They are delicious and very easy to make. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy.]]></shortDesc>

        <title>Mutton Rogan Josh (Kashmiri Pandit style)</title>
        <type>nonVegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Mutton rogan josh is the signature dish of the Kashmiri cuisine which was bought by Mughals. 'Rogan' means oil / fat and 'josh' means intense heat. The dish is an aromatic mutton curry which is cooked in oil on high flame. It is slightly different than the usual mutton curries because of the usage of some unique dry seasonings. Rogan josh can be prepared in two ways - one with onion and garlic, the other one is with yogurt and without onion, garlic. Kashmiri pandits cook this dish by following the second method. I also tried the 'no onion, no garlic' recipe and the taste came out phenomenal. The gravy may seems super spicy but actually it is mildly spicy. The authentic recipe calls for dry ginger (saut) powder and 'ratanjot' (for red colour), I didn't have those so I have used some grated ginger and kashmiri red chilli powder. Do try this delicious mutton rogan josh recipe in your kitchen and enjoy a good meal with your family.]]></shortDesc>

Well, it's bengali style 'chanar kalia' where plain curdled milk / cheese balls are first deep  fried and then cooked in a tomato based gravy. It's a vegetarian delicacy of Bengali cuisine. The dish tastes awesome and goes best with plain basmati rice. In any puja or special occasion, we make this dish and it always becomes the attraction of the entire menu. I made this dish yesterday on lunch for the first time in my life and I pretty much nailed it. Try this easy recipe in your kitchen and enjoy with your family.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Mango is all over the market nowadays. Everybody loves juiciness and sweetness of mango during summer. You can make so many desserts with mango. One of my favourite among them is 'maongo mousse'. Mousse has very light and fluffy texture that's why I love to eat it. Sometimes, to me, after having heavy meals rich dessert becomes overpowering, in those case 'mousse' is very good option. I made my mousse with mango puree and without egg, gelatin. With only three ingredients you can achieve such a lovely and quick dessert.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[The name sounds odd ? Well, I am not crazy, we call this mutton curry vegetarian because it has no onion and garlic. The food we usually offer to our god / godess is called 'bhog' which never contains onion and garlic. During 'kalipuja' or diwali, we Bengalis make this vegetarian mutton curry with the meat of 'pathaboli' (ritual). The taste of this curry is suprisingly delicious, even if there is no onion and garlic. It's a very authentic Bengali lunch maincourse item which you can serve with steamed rice. The recipe is very easy but the taste is unbeatable.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[This is a very typical Bengali veg dish which you can only enjoy with steamed rice. We, bongs, have a very strong connection with 'posto' / poppy seeds and 'shorshe' or mustard seeds. We can creat so many delicious items with these two simple things. Now, 'he' is not a fan of eggplant, except fried version, to feed him this particular vegetable is really painful. I always have to make special dishes with eggplant, otherwise I end up eating all the eggplant and he finishes up rest of the curry, horrible ! So, last week I made this 'begun basonti' and do you know what happened ? He didn't make any fuss and finished up everything with a smile ... yaayy ! The taste of this eggplant gravy came out really good and I will make it again.

'Bhuna' means koshano / in low flame you have to cook something with spices for long time. The curry is very aromatic itself and goes very well with some steamed rice or naan.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Cooking fried kofta / balls in a rich gravy is an old school Bengali delicacy. I guess everybody loves to eat fried balls made with paneer, vegetables, chicken, fish, mutton etc, but after soaking them in a flavouful gravy they become scrumptious. I had some fish fillets in my fridge and couldn't find any better idea than this to use them. Process of making 'Kofta Curry' is tricky and little bit of time consuming, but trust me, the combo of those gravy soaked dumplings with some steamed rice is just heavenly.  ]]></shortDesc>

Every season, every puja and every occasion is incomplete without proper food to us. We love to do grocery shopping everyday in India. No guest can leave our house without atleast a sweet and a glass of water. So, I want to dedicate this post to them who really loves to eat and finds excuse to make special dishes even there is no occasion ! Everyone loves 'grilled chicken' and this one has done on skillet or pan so that everybody can cook even if you don't have any oven. The recipe is very simple but the taste is unbeatably delicious.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I have not grown up too much of eating 'paneer' rather I grew up eating fish, chicken, rice, dal and vegetable dishes. I ate paneer in parties and very few times in restaurants. But after coming to US I learned how to make paneer at home and trust me, those self made soft white cubes gave me immense happiness. So, after that day we both have become paneer lover and have tried several dishes. This 'sahi paneer korma' is another rich mughlai dish from Indian cuisine. In this dish the lightly fried paneer is cooked in a creamy nut based gravy which tastes heavenly with plain chapati or naan or pulao. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a lovely dinner with your loved ones.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Obviously they are not our regular 'aloor chop' / aloo tikki, they are something very special, aloo tikkis are stuffed with spicy minced meat, a little different from usual, but they tastes million bucks !! We Bengalis generally eat 'aloor chop' with puffed rice or tea whereas in other parts of India 'aloo tikki' is always served with chutneys. I will recommend you the second one for these stuffed tikkis as it enhances the taste of the entire dish. Now the ingredients of the stuffing are entirely up to you. I have used minced meat, but you can also use chicken, paneer, fish, lentils etc. Believe me, every time they will taste better and better. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy these delicious tikkis with coke or a glass of beer.]]></shortDesc>

        <type>vegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I have seen two types of cauliflower's roast curry from childhood, my mom makes the yellow + spicy version and the other one is white + sweet version. Both of them are my favourite but today I am sharing the recipe of second version because I have already shared a similar as 1st one cauliflower curry in my earlier post. So, in Bengal this cauliflower white curry becomes very popular during festivals and goes best with pulao or plain roti. Few pure Bengali restaurants serve this dish during puja. The recipe is quite similar with them except some changes like they make this curry with pure 'ghee' but I made it with oil + little ghee etc. The taste came out phenomenal and 'he' finished half of the curry in one sitting. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy with your loved ones.]]></shortDesc>

There was a say that we Bengalis can not eat food without potato. This is true. You have to add potatoes to this dish because there are many people like me and my husband who likes potatoes more than mutton pieces specially in this curry.  As a Bengali its my pleasure to share this recipe with you. *Note: you must take that special bhaat ghum otherwise you will feel incomplete.]]></shortDesc>

The taste and aroma was phenomenal. The flavour of fresh shrimps and long grain basmati rice gave this dish a unique taste, very much different from chicken / mutton biriyani.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[My husband is a craaaazzyyyyy BiriYani lover. So, I thought what could be more exciting than a biriyani treat to him on V day!!! To cook something special, what he loves, will be the perfect way to express my feelings to him on this perfect day. I researched a lot upon new ideas of biriyani, then my eyes got stuck on Chef Sanjay Thumma's 'ulta biriyani'- how beautiful it is!! I won't say that this is the authentic Arabian 'Maqlooba' because their cooking process and recipe are slightly different than ours. Anyway, I was searching for some new ideas and then found one. I was also impressed by its recipe, it's a one pot biriyani. You don't have to spend half of your day in kitchen making biriyani, the dish will take just an hour. This biriyani has soft, juicy chicken pieces, beautiful long grain rice and some mild flavours. Try this easy peasy upside down Chicken Biriyani in your kitchen and enjoy a perfect dinner with your (biriyani loving) partner ]]>&#x1f609;&#x1f609;<![CDATA[ ...

'He' adores only two vegetables in his life, one is potato and the other one is cauliflower. You can impress him with any type of cauliflower dish. So, is there any doubt about what I'm talking about ?? Obviously about 'fulkopir pokora' or 'gobi pakore' !! One of our favorite weekday's meal is 'rice', 'veg daal' and these fritters. Generally in two ways you can make these fritters, one - you have to boil the florets before frying and two- you can stir fry them before deep frying like we Bengalis do. Believe me, the taste becomes delicious. You can enjoy your lunch more with these crunchy fritters.]]></shortDesc>

Its nothing but a dry fish curry with a tasty extra addition of green peas paste - as simple as that. When I was in school, on 1 of my birthday, mom made this special fish curry for me. That was the first and also last time I ate this dish, but still can remember the unique taste. So, two days before I thought to make something new with fish, suddenly remembered about this one. Immediately I gave a call to mom and asked for the recipe. She told me, I followed every line of her and Taaddaaa... a spicy+sweet+tangy fish curry came out from my kitchen.

        <add-title>Potato and Cauliflower curry / Aloo Fulkopir torkari</add-title>
        <type>vegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[We, nonvegetarian people, generally ordered nonveg dishes while eating at restaurants or dhabas. But we also love to eat home cooked vegetarian meals. In one of our trip to Digha before marriage, we made a stop at the famous 'Sher-e-punjab' for heavy breakfast. We ate there several times before but never did breakfast, so, that was our first time. As it was morning, we orderd veg like 'aloo paratha', 'aloo gobi', 'roti', 'bhindi masala' and 'lassi'. All of them were delicious but I will never forget the taste of 'aloo gobi'. Oh my god, my mouth is full of water right now !! It was the tasty, spicy and chatpata veg curry I have ever had. Bengalis usually make 'aloo-fulkopi' as a thick runny curry but that was a dry curry and goes best with roti and some salads. You can also give this yummy curry in lunchbox with bread. Try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turns out.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Last month we, two, went for shopping at our nearest outlet mall. We often go there for shopping. A food truck 'Kebabeque' was a new edition to the food court. They served middle eastern food like 'falafel rice', 'hummus', 'shawarma platter' etc. We took a rice bowl with falafel. They served a good amount of flavourful saffron rice, fresh spinach, some good falafel, tasty hummus and tzatziki sauce. We really loved everything in that bowl. But the sauce caught my main attention. It was so fresh, the flavours were unique and added a different taste to the whole bowl. So, after coming home, I started to do research about this 'tzatziki' sauce and I never thought that the ingredients will be so simple. I made this sauce next day with some turkish kebabs and we enjoyed every bite of them. Try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turns out.]]></shortDesc>

There are so many colorful vegetables available in grocery market during winter. I told you before that my love for winter is only because of food.

'Baingan bharta' is a very popular dhaba food in India. A simple veggie with loads of flavour will make your dinner a special one.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I have many stories about 'aloor porota' in my life. My mom used to give me pure bengali style 'aloor porota' in my lunch box during school life and my friends were always a fan of my lunch box. That was my first story of this porota. When I was in college, we (my family) loved to eat 'dhaba food' during travel. In India, each and every dhaba serve 'aloo ka paratha'. I tasted their paratha many times and they were delicious. The taste was different from my mom's porota. This was the second story. The last one is from my dearest friend Monica. When I was in Jersy, one of my punjabi friend Monica, was an expert in making 'aloo ka paratha'. She literally taught me how to make them. Her paratha tastes heavenly. So, these paratha stories are parts of my life. As my husband doesn't like wheat paratha / atta paratha, I had to make them with flour / maida. You will fall in love with those parathas once you make them. Just give it a try.]]></shortDesc>

        <title>Tandoori Chicken Wraps</title>
        <type>nonVegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Last week, from Monday to Friday, I was very lazy and didn't do much innovative cooking. We really got bored of eating usual meals. So, I thought to do something simple but new in the weekend. I had some boneless chicken and homemade <a href='http://spicyworld.in/tortilla.html'>tortillas</a> in my kitchen. Suddenly planned to make some wraps. But then I was wondering about the flavour of the filling. 'He' suggested to give 'tandoori' flavour and I did it. You will not believe that those were the best wraps I have ever made. They were really scrumptious and will make them soon again. Try this in your kitchen and you will love them too.]]></shortDesc>

        <title>Baked Spicy Chicken Pasta</title>
        <type>nonVegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Its true that I love eating pasta after coming usa. In India I was more fond of noodles, ramen or maggie. But recently I experimented couple of recipes on pasta and they turned out really well. I love my pasta on spicy side, that's why I mentioned it in the title. After baking with cheese, the taste of this dish became phenomenal. If you do not want to bake or use cheese, then make this dish without them. No worries, it also tastes delicious, believe me. You can say this dish is kind of one-pot-meal, usually don't need any sides. I love 'rotini' pasta, you can use 'penne', 'maccaroni', 'shells' or any kind of your choice. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy the meal with your family.]]></shortDesc>

Its been two years I am away from home (Kolkata). My papa used to buy me lots of crackers a day before diwali, we toast them in sunlight and in the evening of diwali my (maternal) uncle bought me some more crackers for his 'vagni'. Then around 8 pm me and my papa used to decorate our roof with candles and after that we started doing fireworks with our family. Ohh, I almost forgot to tell you about food. My mom used to make various types of sweets at home and we enjoyed them a lot. So, I made 'baked rosogolla' for this diwali, my first attempt and I nailed it.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[When an inch of oil or ghee floats upon gravy, yes its 'mughlai nawabi dish'. 'Nawab' means king. This category of curries have nice colored, rich, thick, creamy gravy. 'Chicken Korma' is my favourite one. You can easily eat this curry once in a month along with 'biriyani', 'pulaao', 'butter naan' or 'rumali roti'. Do not put this kind of food in your regular diet because you have to make or eat korma without any guilt, otherwise you will never enjoy the richness of mughlai food.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[When I was in college, I loved to do some cooking with my mom. 'Dhaniya Chicken' was one of my teenage speciality dish. Dhaniya / dhonepata means coriander leaves. I only prefer to use garlic and don't like to use whole spices for this dish. According to me, the strong aroma of whole spices dominate the flavour of fresh coriander leaves. After a long time, last night I made 'dhonepata chicken' along with some steamed rice and enjoyed every moment of prepping, cooking and eating just like those college days ]]>&#x1f60a;<![CDATA[.

        <type>vegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA['Khatta' means tangy/sour and 'baingan' means eggplant/begun. Most probably this dish is from Kashmiri cuisin. I do not have much knowledge about this cuisin but I can assure you that you will never forget this eggplant recipe. Last wednesday we both wanted to eat veg in dinner and I had an eggplant(begun) in my fridge. So, I googled for some spicy veg recipes made with eggplant, and my eyes got stuck to this one. The recipe is simple and very easy to make. I just made a little change, as 'he' doesn't like tamarind (tetul/imli) in his food, I had to use yogurt instead of it. Believe me the taste came out really delicious. It goes very well with steamed rice or plain roti. Try this in your kitchen and share your story with us.]]></shortDesc>

        <title>Macher Jhol</title>
        <type>nonVegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Bengalis make various kinds of fish curry with different types of fishes. The most simple and easy one is 'macher jhol' or fish curry. 'Jhol' means runny version of a curry. This dish is usually served as lunch with steamed rice and we all are fan of it. In 'macher jhol' you can use rohu / katla / tilapia / pomfret / pabda etc. One can add many kinds of vegetables like potato, cauliflower, eggplant, green peas, carrot etc. I always make this dish with potato and cauliflower because of 'him']]>&#x1f609;<![CDATA[. He typically loves this combo. According to me, there is only one restriction about this dish. You have to use 'green chilies' only for the heat and flavour. Try not to use red chili powder or dry red chili because it will make a huge difference. So, here is the recipe how I make 'macher jhol' for my family.]]></shortDesc>
        <ingrediants><![CDATA[<ul><li>4 fish pieces.</li><li>4 pieces of potato.</li><li>4-5 pieces of cauliflower.</li><li>half onion thinly sliced.</li><li>half tomato chopped.</li><li>1 Tablespoon nigella seeds (kalojeera).</li><li>5 green chilies.</li><li>2 Teaspoons turmeric powder.</li><li>half Teaspoons roasted cumin powder.</li><li>Salt and sugar.</li><li>half cup of mustard oil.</li><li>Warm water.</li></ul>]]></ingrediants>
        <process><![CDATA[<div>Wash the fish pieces very well and then marinate them with some salt and 1 Teaspoon turmeric powder for 15 minutes.</div><div>Heat oil in a kadai or pan. Fry the vegetables for 5 minutes in hot oil. Remove them in a plate.</div><div>Then add the marinated fish pieces one by one in hot oil.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-2.jpg" /><div>Fry both side of them for 5 minutes. Then remove it from the pan. You can also keep them on a paper towel, it will absorb the extra oil. While frying the vegetables do not make them dark in color.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-3.jpg" /><div>In the same hot oil add nigella seeds and 2 green chilies. Saute them. If you prefer to cook in less oil then remove some oil from the pan. But do not change the oil otherwise the taste will differ.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-4.jpg" /><div>After a minute add sliced onion and pinch of salt. Fry them for 4 minutes in medium flame. Do not make the onion dark in color.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-5.jpg" /><div>Then add chopped tomato, pinch of salt, 1 Teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 Teaspoon cumin powder and half Teaspoon sugar. Mix it very well in low flame for 5 minutes.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-6.jpg" /><div>When the oil starts separating add some warm water and 3 green chilies. Mix it well. If you like more heat, you can add more green chilies. Try to avoid red chili powder or dry red chili for this recipe only.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-7.jpg" /><div>After 2 minutes add the fried vegetables. Cook this for 8 minutes.</div><div>Then add the fried fish pieces. Mix gently with spatula and cook it for another 5 minutes.</div><div>Check the seasoning and if you want more curry add some warm water.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-8.jpg" /><div>Turn off the heat and rest it for 5 minutes.</div>]]></process>

Let me tell you the story first. Last week I took an attempt to make 'sondesh', but the taste came out very less sweeter. I got panicked and immediately called my only life saver 'mom'. She adviced me to follow the process of 'rosmalai'. In rosmalai we put 'rosogolla' in kheer and in my case, I put 'sondesh' in kheer. Magically it became a new, frequently demanded dessert to my family. 'Makhmali' means very soft in hindi. 'Sondesh' will become very soft after adding it in kheer, that's why I named it 'makhmali sondesh'.]]></shortDesc>
