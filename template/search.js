Mango is one of my favorite fruit with which you can make so many things like Yogurt, Ice cream, Phirni, Kheer, Cake, Cheesecake and what not. This season I made Mango Sondesh, taste and texture came out really good. You can make them with Ricotta cheese also, in that case add some milk powder as ricotta cheese is much thinner than Paneer. Mango pulp is going to give the Sandesh very refreshing and nice aroma. For color I have used saffron. Try this simple recipe in your kitchen and let me know how it turned out for you.",

They cook the mutton in a yogurt and onion based sauce with lots of chilies and garlicky flavor.

He finished the lunch (read there wasn't any meat curry, not even leftover) with a big smile, that too on weekend. This spicy prawn curry worked like a magic. So, I had to share with you all the recipe of this Bengali delicacy - kosha chingrir kalia. Though the word 'kosha' suggests slow cooking which we are not gonna do with prawns otherwise they will come out rubbery, but also suggests a dry (oily) and spicy gravy and in this recipe we will go with the second variety. Hope you will find the recipe interesting with the detailed video.",

Make sure you carry your passport & visa docs along with you in the first few days once you land in US.<br/><\/div><div>2. If you like home food you can buy some rice or daal (dry items) from nearby Indian store, do some research before coming to the city you are supposed to go. If absolutely no Indian store nearby bring 3-4 days supply with you.<br/><\/div><div>3. Bring some must have utensils like pressure cooker, karai etc those you can get here but might be expensive and hard to get within first week of arrival.<br/><\/div><div>4. Bring formals because they are costly and in some cases alteration or proper fitting might be a problem for you.<br/><\/div><div>5. If you are going in winter season bring one or 2 sweaters and one jacket, because you will find variety of options here.<br/><\/div><div>6. Book a hotel prior coming, preferably hotels like Extended Stay America where you will have a kitchen for cooking and they also provide utensils to cook.<br/><\/div><div>7. Ensure there is a target, walmart or Heb (in case of Texas) nearby the hotel so that you can get supplies.<br/><\/div><div><h2>What to do when I land in USA?<\/h2><\/div><div>1. Book supershuttle to commute from airport to hotel, their service is awesome and price is reasonable & staffs are great.<br/><\/div><div>2. Never take a private cab, they might charge you super high.<br/><\/div><div>3. Get a phone connection as soon as possible. Preffereably AT&T or T-mobile with good amount of data pack because thats needed for everything.<br/><\/div><div>4. For daily commute to work or school you can use Uber or Lyft or any other ride sharing apps. Research your city before finding an option online.<br/><\/div><div><h2>How to search for Apartment?<\/h2><\/div><div>1. Look for apartments near your work or suitable to your child's need (school).<br/><\/div><div>2. Here schools are tied to location and apartments are also tied to them so look for it while you search. (As I don't have the experience of that, I am not sharing anything, you might search in Google for that).<br/><\/div><div>3. If you are coming for the first time you won't have SSN (Social Security Number) yet so make sure when apply for apartments mention that, in that case you might need to provide high security deposit. Generally if your rent is $1200/month your deposit is less than that, may be it's $1000. (This may vary based upon location and Apartment complex's rule).<br/><\/div><div>4. While signing the lease you need to keep in mind following things: lease term/how long?, what is the lease breakage policy, connect electricity in your name, have a renters insurance, apply for Internet connection etc. your apartment complex's management will help you and guide you with that, they are very helpful.<br/><\/div><div>5. Make sure to check your apartment before signing lease, you need to look for your preferences and amenities such as washer & drier whether they are inside unit or you need to rent or pay for that or use the centralized laundry of the apartment, microwave is provided or not, gas is a payed or included, heating is included or not, means do you need to pay for that additionally etc etc.<br/><\/div><div><h2>Now I moved into Apartment, what to do now?<\/h2><\/div><div>1. Go to nearest Walmart or Target for basic required items such as Toilet curtain, door mats, if you are fond of white light search for it (they are called white light), kitchen utensils etc.<br/><\/div><div>2. Furniture can be purchased online or from stores like Walmart, Target (for Short Term stay), Costco, IKEA (for better options and long term stay as they have expensive items but last long as well)<br/><\/div><div>3. You can also buy furniture from stores like Goodwill, they sell used items at cheapest price.<br/><\/div><div>4. Always buy brand new mattress because there is a high possibility of having bed bugs or something like that if you buy used.<br/><\/div><div>5. You can order dining tables and chairs online, as well as sofa, bed frame & mattress. I would prefer online because they deliver at doorstep. There is no hassles of bringing that to your floor.<br/><\/div><div>6. Everything you need to assemble so its better to buy an automatic screwdriver which will save lot of your effort at the time of assembling the items you buy.<br/><\/div><div><h2>What to do in first few weeks?<\/h2><\/div><div>1. You must apply for Internet connection as soon as you move into the apartment.<br/><\/div><div>2. Open your bank account with the bank that is available in your state. Most of the states have Bank of America.<br/><\/div><div>3. After 2 weeks or so, look for the nearest SSN office and apply for your SSN. This will allow you to do almost all possible transactions and an unique record of your financial as well as all kind of transactions. This will be helpful for Tax purpose and all your future stay.<br/><\/div><div>4. Once you receive 2 address proof (apartment lease document) and another utility bill or bank statement (mailed to your apartment address, not online) you can apply for a driving license. Note: Check with DMV website for the documents required for applying the driving license before going to DMV.<br/><\/div><div>5. If your spouse doesn't want a driving license, you must apply for a state ID as that might be required for age, address & identity proof and it is accepted in domestic air travel and every where in US.<\/div><div><h2>Thats it, enjoy your trip<\/h2>Hope this article will help.

Nowadays you can find many fake dhabas and taste of their food is also fake, nowhere close to the authentic ones. Luckily few old and original dhabas in India still sells the best meals. After tasting those foods, you will probably think that their cooks must have some kind of magical hands. I once tasted their 'mutton curry' .... a rich, creamy, flavourful gravy and juicy, succulent meat pieces. Last weekend I recreated the same dish in my kitchen and surprisingly he said it tastes exactly like that dhaba's mutton curry &#128515;&#128524;. The recipe is very simple and easy to follow. Do try it at your home and enjoy a great lunch with your family.",

I have already posted 'mutton dopyaza' recipe, then I thought this time why not with chicken? Confirmed the idea with my hubby and 'chicken dopyaza' got selected for main-course along with 'mishti pulao'. They both gave me very positive reaction after finishing the dinner .... yaay &#128515; ! The recipe won't give you any stress, you can easily make them for big gatherings. If you are the host, then it's the perfect dish. The gravy is rich and very flavorful with juicy chicken pieces. 'Dopyaza' means you have to use double amount of onion - I used onion paste and cubed onion. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a delicious, fuss free dinner.",

You can get this fritter with some puffed rice and green chili in Bengal from any 'choper dokan'/fast food centers. When they serve this in 'thonga'/paper bag, the feel and look always increase my appetite a bit.\nKhichuri - Beguni or Daal - Bhaat - Beguni ... which combo should I make for lunch ? as I have picked two very beautiful eggplants from grocery store and he was constantly pushing me to make Beguni. As it was Friday Bong Eats uploaded '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzfEnYxzjUg\">Kancha Moong Daal<\/a>' recipe and I just found my answer.

To bring that exact flavor of restaurant I have used 'tandoori masala', believe me, do not skip this masala because it will definitely give the taste a big uplift.

Swamiji represented India and gave speech - 'Sisters and brothers of America ...', at the Parliament of religion which was occurred inside this famous building.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9c8c1e7f-7411-4088-9690-5d6adeafc9d0.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-5d79a527-bb0d-4912-89ee-cd4c5b485251.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-23523f92-0956-4de0-92f8-da4d7d596867.jpg\" /><div>We also went to the Chicago River walk ... don't ever miss this walk, it is charming and wonderful. After that we looked at the clock and it was 2.00pm. So, decided to go to the hotel (<a href=\"http://www.doubletreemagmile.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Chicago - Magnificent Mile', this.href);\">DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Chicago - Magnificent Mile<\/a>) as the check in time was 3.00pm and also we were tired. Our room ($181 per day) was on 20th floor. It was very clean as expected. The bed, towel, sofa, toilette were very impressive. Although you can't keep your personal drink in the fridge as it was filled with their expensive (!!) drinks, they should keep some empty spot for us so that we can keep our own stuffs, which is a bit awkward for us.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-12495fd7-0d29-4536-9636-20f7e48163e4.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-24274922-e12f-4ef4-b882-6ca43833cb86.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><div>After taking a short nap and freshen up, we went to the famous <a href=\"https://navypier.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Navy Pier of Chicago', this.href);\">Navy Pier of Chicago<\/a>.<\/div><div class='videoIframeDiv'><div class=\"videoDiv\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2UVG48n83BQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><\/div><div>It is a beautiful place with splendid views and filled with life. We took an Chicago Architectural Boat Tour ($35 per person) which was 75 minutes long water journey into Chicago river.<\/div><div class='videoIframeDiv'><div class=\"videoDiv\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJsl1yWzB_Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><\/div><div>The boat covered almost the whole city and the tour guide gave very informative descriptions about the buildings of Chicago. As that afternoon was very hot, we got exhausted after an hour. So, I will recommend you to take this type of trip after 6 or 7pm in the summer days.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-252c9ce9-7a50-4cb1-b52d-afa450a7acf5.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-bb71c203-2972-48d3-9c7b-b3feaac486c3.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-cf66220e-ce04-4883-b7e6-84656284480c.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-f0f4575e-c477-4032-a1e6-e38de1ce9969.jpg\" /><div>While the boat left us at the Navy Pier at the end of the trip, we bought an awesome looking ice cream cone and started our journey towards the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Water_Tower\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Chicago Water Tower', this.href);\">Chicago Water Tower<\/a>. We took a bus, it took about 8 minutes to go there.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1d3fa4fa-8523-49d4-91a2-bf4652e5452f.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><div>The tower is located at North Michigan Avenue. It is the second oldest water tower in USA. The story says, this tower was the only building which survived the Chicago Fire and also it is one of the few surviving structures still standing. But it must be a place to visit if you are in Chicago.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-87e989a9-fddb-4683-907f-d470deab7f8b.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><div>While coming back from the water tower we suddenly tracked down an indian restaurant - '<a href=\"http://www.indiangardenchicago.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Indian Garden', this.href);\">Indian Garden<\/a>' which was few foot steps away from our hotel. The ambience of that place was pretty decent and many tables were filled with people. We placed an order ($37) for - a chicken dum biriyani, a chicken korma and a butter naan.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-c4d2b134-bd20-4f2d-ab18-75ad21be7a0f.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-e7c52051-eb00-44f5-b31e-f7f141f123a6.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-6ca1ecf0-f4a6-4544-8dbf-1ebb65dccbb8.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1c798196-b3c6-4a8f-a2b6-599c80780e94.jpg\" /><div>Well, the 'biriyani' was just a mixture of chicken curry and rice, you can see that from the pictures, it came with a 'raita' which was good. Korma was ok, there was no complementary rice with it! But their 'naan' was very soft and fresh. They also served 'papad' and 3 types of chutney as a complimentary starter which was really tasty. Overall food was totally overpriced.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d10e7bd5-023b-433b-935b-ee2a33670893.jpg\" /><div>We started our next day with little breakfast ($8) from Dunkin Donuts, which was very close to our hotel - 1 egg n cheese croissant, 1 pack of hash browns, 1 vanilla chai and 1 frozen hot chocolate .... delicious !<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-de92b810-8a30-422a-a27e-291b4e977f3d.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d8e96630-7923-481e-9a64-a5628bcc6a24.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1105fd24-29bd-4eeb-bd42-e9017fdb3867.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><div>Our first destination was '<a href=\"http://theskydeck.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Willis Tower', this.href);\">Willis Tower<\/a>' also called as Sears Towers. We took <a href=\"https://www.lyft.com/invite/AMITAVA488489\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Lyft', this.href);\">Lyft<\/a> and got there within 10 minutes. It's 108 storied and the 2nd tallest building of USA. The famous sky-deck is located at 103rd floor of the tower. Elevators will take you there within quick time.  It is the most popular attraction point in Chicago. The view from that floor was marvelous. We spent 2 memorable hours within it.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-6ef87b76-5999-4ef4-a249-eb2cf1f8ff89.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-c1a38e21-4177-4de3-bd86-b89a2311b1c8.jpg\" /><div class='videoIframeDiv'><div class=\"videoDiv\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HppFMPaasKU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-431648f8-4a6e-4b57-8e22-dfa40044a257.jpg\" /><div>Then our next stop was '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Fountain\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Buckingham Fountain', this.href);\">Buckingham Fountain<\/a>' which is located at the '<a href=\"http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/grant-park/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Grant Park', this.href);\">Grant Park<\/a>'. The fountain is a landmark of Chicago. Many tourists and locals visit the fountain every day. It's one of the very beautiful place in Chicago. Water (light) shows occur from evening to night. We couldn't get the chance to see it as their gate was closed for a concert. But morning view was very refreshing and wonderful.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9a3d1522-afd3-4c91-a0f8-db35f634ca36.jpg\" /><div>Another famous point is <a href=\"http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/millennium_park.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Millennium Park', this.href);\">Millennium Park<\/a> walkable distance from Grant Park. We went there as well and it was just awesome.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-b89db16e-3e24-407e-b4f2-b5b7ef090e81.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-cc66c447-6885-4fc1-aa0c-33d4c91ce7bc.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1f3baf11-9574-420d-b895-aff285ef3cdd.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><div>Now it's time to reveal about that attraction without which Chicago trip remains incomplete - The Bean or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Gate\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Cloud_Gate', this.href);\">Cloud Gate<\/a>. We all know, it was designed by an Indian artist - Anish Kapoor. The sculpture is named 'the bean' because of its shape, made with mercury and it reflects the city's beautiful skyline. The morning view was totally different from the night view. Both were very impressive.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-8c82b42e-c84d-4be6-9234-bd2a5ead9e9b.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-5b4b32bf-1a1b-4097-9487-e872c3cd09b6.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-0ce1ddba-8064-4662-ac48-425d10c6faab.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><div>After finishing these, we got very much tired and hungry. One of the legendary food item of Chicago is - Deep dish Pizza and we had it at <a href=\"http://www.unos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Uno Pizza', this.href);\">Uno Pizzeria & Grill: Uno Chicago Grill - Deep Dish Pizza<\/a>. Our server Phill was very helpful and decent. We ordered for a small (really enough for two of us) deep dish pizza with chicken, onion and jalapeños. It was delicious. They took 45 minutes to make it but the wait was totally worthy. The pizza was hot, fresh and very heavy. After that we wanted to taste Chicago style 'cheesecake', well it was nothing fancy, just like a very normal cheesecake. Overall our experience was very very good at this busiest restaurant.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9e4fe450-dd04-4b55-885c-f0508c241a0d.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-f34b462c-4358-403a-abef-0a5fb7622dba.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-8b04442d-cbc9-4b9a-8b4a-bc0b717c5d67.jpg\" /><div>At the evening we again went at the Cloud Gate to see the evening view of The Bean. You can say from the pictures that it is wonderful and the place is very happening. The street was packed with traffic and we got late for our dinner.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d56ab2ad-e00f-4ebb-90c6-f2cab7dceb9f.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-12c794f5-e29b-494c-bc43-4df90c7ffd6d.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-0fda35b8-685a-4b02-ad05-d6063f3be9d1.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-0ad6c0f6-c8db-4ca2-a723-e6f106859648.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-b533459b-f8bd-4955-aa59-542d4a03d367.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><div>I eyed a spanish restaurant named 'Emilio's Tapas' from the first day which was very nearby from our hotel. So we got into an Lyft to get there quickly for our late night dinner. Ahh, the experience was awful. At first we placed 3 orders - a salad plate with duck breast, a casserole of chicken and a grilled calamari plate. The quantity of them were surprisingly less / tiny. Salad was good, my casserole was also ok, but calamari plate had a very burnt taste. Then we again placed order for a chicken item and they gave us beef. After that shamelessly they charged us $48 and the server was not even sorry for serving beef instead of Chicken ... what the hell !!<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-71edbc3c-01cd-47fb-83b0-b473a9496350.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-802d061a-8dc3-416e-b399-82130a5409ce.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-f8fcedbe-6478-4a46-82a6-40f6555f4c96.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-9bcab44e-6b0d-4c58-8c0b-3c08581c0495.jpg\" /><div>Next day we again had the same breakfast with a refreshing mango smoothie instead of hot chocolate. It was a very relaxing day for us, the sky was filled with clouds, breeze was lightly cold and we walked the entire day upon '<a href=\"https://www.themagnificentmile.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Magnificent Mile', this.href);\">The Magnificent Mile<\/a>'. It's a famous road, packed with upscale shops and small size shopping malls.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-80524215-d7a2-4dbc-8cbb-74703f8ce293.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-5466b2cc-b3c1-47a3-9b5d-e7e348a4ba90.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-11c28525-2675-4e79-bf1d-ddf06cce3e63.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-1d19cf75-e876-4c3a-ad4a-7c50799356b1.jpg\" /><div>When there is a <a href=\"http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: Cheesecake Factory', this.href);\">Cheesecake Factory<\/a>, there is always a big smile you can find on 'his' face. He is a crazy fan of them. So, as usual we had our lunch ($42) there - Dynamic Shrimp, White Chicken Chili and Factory Chicken Nachos there. The batter fried shrimp was the star and you can never complain about their quantity. We loved the other 2 Mexican dishes too. Just mind blowing nothing to complain about.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-a542c88d-b463-461d-aa23-c221451167f9.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-3bfcae22-a8fa-4f01-9b08-fb5610d528f1.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-d0186dd9-8932-4090-a029-ae4377b44eaf.jpg\" /><div>After returning to the hotel, the rain started and the weather became more romantic. We went to the 'Navy Pier' again to enjoy the evening. And yeaahhh the decision was perfect. The sky became totally clear by then. We spent 4 long hours there and then had our dinner.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/we-at-chicago-fa72cd3d-548e-4f90-95ec-163b14822e13.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-22135803-9461-4f53-ab9d-f1c35613f9c1.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-542c6954-0309-4bad-aafd-6ee8633769b3.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-04fc371a-cf71-44f7-a665-7fc59a44d58e.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><div>There were plenty of restaurants filled with people. One of them was '<a href=\"http://www.dmkrestaurants.com/restaurants/fish-bar/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"refLinksInternal\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'External Link', 'Click: DMKs Fish Bar', this.href);\">DMK's Fish Bar<\/a>'. We went there and our order was ($48) - 2 ginger ale, 1 spicy turkey burger, 1 crispy calamari and 1 fish and chips. Calamari was very good, topped with some cheese and pickled jalapeños. In my burger-  the bun was very soft, patty tasted good, just didn't like the cheese. The battered cod fish fillets were so crunchy and delicious. The thing we disliked was their french fries - they were very soggy, otherwise everything else was spot on.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-74d51f0a-6776-4dc5-aa7e-5f4c5ded9262.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-b17abf64-74b6-4cf5-8f83-05ccbf6b0d75.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-85a9b965-27ae-41bf-a2a7-6b83f442a261.jpg\" /><div>This was the last day of our trip, we were leaving Chicago. Started with very light and yummy breakfast we brought previous day night from 711 - 1 marble cake and 2 bananas. Then checked out from the hotel and went to the airport. While reaching there we got an email that our flight is delayed for 1 hour ... bummer ! After the security check, we had lunch - chicken shawarma, spicy chicken burger with fries from 'Gold Coast Dogs'. My shawarma was good, french fries were very crunchy, but his burger was no at all spicy.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-7919a733-874d-4eba-9dc2-8ae4c939cb81.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-a63d4d48-dfe0-496e-812f-d3d1509b4463.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/trip-to-chicago-3e0dbec5-f814-4b0d-a9b1-b8892f3a01e6.jpg\" /><div>After waiting for 1 hour they again announced for another 3 hours delay due to bad weather.

And based upon that if your are changing page content that's not good as well.<\/li><li>Shorter and meaningful page URLs are recommended.<\/li><li>If both page URL and Page Title are same then its highly searchable.<\/li><li>Do not include stop words in the Page URL or in Page title.<\/li><li>Less folder nesting in the URL is recommended.<\/li><li>Case mixing in the URL is not a good option, try to use all lower case.<\/li><li>Repetition of same word in the URL is not recommended.<\/li><\/ul><\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/web-hosting-essentials-00783934-1332-4baf-8da3-5d0b67a125c1.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><div><b>HTML Structure/Design<\/b> Some high level HTML design points are mentioned here. You can always search in web for more details related to the topic. <br/><ul><li>Each page must have unique page title.<\/li><li>All the web page title should be same as H1 tag of the page to gain more weight in SEO.<\/li><li>All Images in the website must have proper ALT tag which describes the image and also add title tags.<\/li><li>Inside body tag use proper nested HTML structure.<\/li><\/ul><\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/web-hosting-essentials-8198d354-2371-4b14-b02b-5551f343258c.jpg\"  style='width:75%'/><div><b><u>Performance Improvement Considerations<\/u><\/b><\/div><div>Its always a challenge to load quickly and support concurrent users for any web applications. Some quick things you can do without investing lot of time and effort.<br/><ul><li>For javascript and CSS files user compressor such as YUI Compressor which helps minifying those files (basically convert them into optimum file with a single line, less size). This helps those to load quickly and also puts a factor of security for your Javascript code that way those codes are not readable by blank eye.<\/li><li>Use Content Delivery Network (CDN) which allows your static assets such as images, CSS and JavaScripts to be delivered from outside your server infrastructure. This is kind of cloud server near your physical location which servers those files for better performance.<\/li><li>User max of 2 to 3 types of Fonts in the webpage and try not to use custom fonts those needs to be loaded from third party source or from your own server because that will slowdown your overall performance.<\/li><li>Images must be web ready (72 to 96dpi), not in high DPI or printable formats.<\/li><li>Keep monitoring your page speed in regular intervals via browser plugins for free such as Google Chrome developer console. And fix problems as and when you notice them.<\/li><li>Do not use inline style or JavaScript instead try to put all JavaScript and CSS into a single file each of them.<\/li><\/ul><\/div><div><b><u>Meta Tags in Web Page<\/u><\/b><\/div><div>All webpage must have the following meta tags that way its easy for search engines to index them and store their information in proper format.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/web-hosting-essentials-a337166a-e94f-4fe2-ab03-da191444b36b.jpg\"  style='width:75%'/><div><b><u>Setting up Google Analytics<\/u><\/b><\/div><div>Google Analytics account setup is a must for any website or blog this allows you to track lot of information, generate reports such as page views, country/city where you website is accessed the most, devices those are used the most, from where most of the traffic is coming to your website.

As this is a 'Kolhapuri' gravy, you have to incorporate coconut. I didn't have fresh one that's why I used dried one. We both found the taste and flavour of the dish extremely delicious.

The day 1 starts lazily and we were not able to decide where are we heading to?? Finally decided to visit Downtown Austin.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/second-bar-kitchen-76d13a4a-22cc-4952-b035-ccad1287fa3d.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><div>We took our favorite Capital Metro Bus from Tech Ridge Bay I towards Republic Square Station (SB) around 11:50AM and it took about 50 minutes (cheap ride for both of us in the express bus a day pass costs $7) for us to reach there.

We started to walk towards the river and we opted to go to \"Second Bar & Kitchen\" for our lunch (that was the intension of visiting Downtown).

As it was winter, I wouldn't say that scenic view during road journey was good because most of the trees were leafless. Anyway, after reaching there we first went towards our hotel 'The Adolphus' and checked in there. The hotel was at downtown and interior was 80's. The decoration will give you a nice feeling and our room was pretty good. We got little tired after the journey, so, took rest for an hour.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-f5c253f9-1852-4116-a349-5ced86f63aee.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-42e876f5-91cd-4963-b505-fbfd6c8a04c3.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-cdc5f407-4675-40bc-bd73-a046d2031027.jpg\" /><div><b><u>Attractions<\/u><\/b><br/><\/div><div><b>The Old Red Museum (01/29/2016)<\/b><br/>was our first stop after we got out from hotel and walked a little bit towards south on Commerce Street, it was 8 to 10 minutes of walk from our hotel. Old Red Museum or Dallas County Courthouse is also known as Old Red Courthouse. The building is made of red sandstone with marble accents. It is a historic government building. We loved the color and texture of the building. From the opposite side of the street, the view of this building was amazing. That was a busy street with little park and fountains.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-ec7ea3b9-ff2a-437e-b47d-f22db997fd58.jpg\" /><div><b>The Sixth Floor Museum at Deplay Plaza (01/29/2016)<\/b><br/> is our next destination which is few foot step away from Old Red Museum. This building is one of the historic landmark of Dallas and USA. The plaza was typically visited by tourists now-a-days. Since 1989 more than six million people visited this plaza. The building has its own significance because of president John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. The museum is located at 6th Floor of the Texas School Book Depository building.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-29acae94-60f9-4c7c-abf2-6704e07a09a5.jpg\" /><div><b>Arboretum and Botanical Garden (01/30/2016)<\/b><br/>is a great place to start day two. We like nature and flowers so this place is the dream place for us. 66 acers of land with lot of flowers, trees and White Rock lake made this place a great tourist destination. We saw lot of families with their kids enjoying the sunny day. We started around 9:30AM from hotel and reached around 10AM, as the public transport is good so we thought of coming here by bus (#060), which takes about 30 minutes (took $5 for both of us). They charged $5 each for the entry fee. We spent around 2 hours in this place and took lot of photos of various kinds of winter flowers and obviously both me and my hubby posed for some awesome pics. We have seen lot of squirrels and captured their activities. We decided to have our lunch at downtown so took the same bus back to downtown.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-b1154edd-3c04-4d5b-819f-81130c9e1954.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-254d6894-300d-4a09-acde-42c010b5cab0.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-50360c4c-c8fd-40ed-a264-4ba4542b166c.jpg\"  style='width:85%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-af0161de-a3c6-4adc-a4f9-ddc1a03c6026.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><div><b>Downtown Dallas (01/30/2016)<\/b><br/>has lot of exciting things to see, so we started with Thanks-Giving Square, it's a nice place and as usual we started clicking pics.

Lot of kids were playing in water as its a pretty hot day and we feel this place a little over crowded but a place to relax, sit and enjoy with family at the heart of downtown.

It's basically a local bar and restaurant with downtown charm. The staff welcomed us and took order from us although it was a self-serviced restaurant. As we were not in mood of drinking, so we ordered Fish and Chips and Chicken Quesadilla with coke. They took 15-20 minutes to arrive. We are a big fan of 'fish and chips' and they served three fresh pieces of deep fried beer-battered cod fillets over loads of uniquely crunchy french fries with mayonnaise and mint sauce. In Austin almost every restaurant serves 'chicken quesadilla' and we tasted them so many times. In 'City Tavern' they grilled the tortillas with stuffing like cooked chicken, vegetables and cheese then served them with salsa sauce and sour cream. I love their taste and also impressed about it's quantity as I ordered from appetizer section. Overall, we were impressed by the polite, friendly nature of the staff and their food. The costs ($21) was pretty much reasonable as well.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-ddcb0c1f-3a87-4959-8a16-14ce68abc67b.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-51b4a27f-fab3-4ca8-bb97-671ecf05e6a6.jpg\" /><div><b>Press Box Grill (01/30/2016)<\/b><br/>our lunch stop after botanical garden. The restaurant was in a busy street, filled with people. But the staffs were very manageable and friendly. We ordered 'Blackened Salmon with rice and grilled veggies' and 'Buffalo chicken Burger' with coke. They served the food within 25 minutes. In the first dish, a medium size fresh salmon patty, some vegetables were grilled and paired with flavorful rice. Well, in the burger boneless chicken was sautéed with spicy buffalo sauce, topped with blue cheese and came with lots of crunchy fries. We enjoyed the food and ambience. Though we were pretty full, but couldn't resist ourselves from having 'Tiramisu Torte' as dessert. Oh boy, the cake was layered, creamy, soft, and less sweet, perfect for us. We left the place after having $48 lunch and with satisfied heart and smiley face.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-72146840-8451-49d8-bdbb-704ece5b5401.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-a9109dc8-6d92-434a-b373-fb1249060684.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-ed786ab2-6c52-448a-9c9f-5d7255d9254d.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-ab29ab01-2d25-4461-8eb6-120f31419958.jpg\" /><div><b>Wing Bucket (01/30/2016)<\/b><br/>was on the route towards 'old red museum'. I eyed that restaurant from the first day and went there on last day for dinner. Outside as well as inside were fully crowded with loads of wings on each table. After seeing them, we also felt greedy and placed order for 'chicken wings' in 'honey chipotle and margarita chile' sauce and 'fried chicken sandwich' with fries and coke. They offer 19 levels of spice for the chicken wings, can you imagine!!! After 15 minutes the food was served. We started tasting wings, well first 5 minutes were decent, but after that our hands became totally messy with tasty sauces. Then, we noticed it was not only we, every people in that restaurant was in the same condition!! Our sandwich was filled with crispy and saucy boneless chicken strips and was paired with french fries which was dusted with chili powder and salt. We loved each and everything from our $30 order and felt lucky that we didn't miss this one particularly among all others.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-3d5d76be-974f-4fd3-b15c-592defe44b3c.jpg\"  style='width:45%'/><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-973c114d-eeef-4fc2-9394-e23199a9600c.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/dallas-trip-5aa87bd3-cf94-4ca7-848d-65222f31e3b7.jpg\" /><div>Its the last day or our trip, so we packed everything and checked out from the hotel around 9AM. Its time for a coffee, so looking for a Starbucks but where is it!!! All Starbucks are inside office buildings and as its sunday all are closed, Ahhh!!! We took a coffee from 7-Eleven and a water bottle for our 3 and half hour journey back to Austin.<\/div><div>Having a coffee in hand and walking towards the bus stop in the morning time reminded us the days of Kolkata.

I was planning to share our travel and food experience with you.\nPresently we are staying at Austin and our last trip was to California on June, 2015. You can think of how much bore we were for not going outside Austin for past 7 months. We celebrated 'Durga Puja', 'Christmas', 'New Year' in Austin but something was missing!!! So, I took the initiative and planned a very short trip to the nearest city, Dallas. We both wanted some relaxation and refreshment. Did we get that in Dallas?? WoW, yeaahhh... \nWe visited the historic Texas city with lot of cultural heritages and true history of the state. Today I am sharing our experience of Dallas with you. As this is my first travel blog so please let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback.",

It has rivers, mountains and forests.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/nature-with-canon-c6228e74-1670-4c75-82b9-6402f4624e49.jpg\" /><div>The most interesting part of Yellowstone is the hot spring and thrilling volcanic spots. Yellowstone River flows inside the National Park which adds life to the animals and the wild life if the forest.<\/div><img src=\"recipeimages/nature-with-canon-c1426a3f-acd9-4ced-adf2-387e51ff4f3a.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/nature-with-canon-62fb0167-ea1f-4c2b-9b24-7ddbf002346e.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/nature-with-canon-933539b0-0e26-4882-82df-06e671800a1a.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/nature-with-canon-222ff417-8eb7-43c9-b992-e325dcb0667b.jpg\" /><img src=\"recipeimages/nature-with-canon-45c169f2-5eaa-4c65-a050-09a59c97dcad.jpg\"  style='width:85%'/><div><b>Lake Powell<\/b><\/div><div>We mainly stopped at \"Carl Hayden Visitor Center at Glen Canyon Dam\"  and saw the beautiful Lake Powell.

        "shortDesc": "Mutton rogan josh is the signature dish of the Kashmiri cuisine which was bought by Mughals. 'Rogan' means oil / fat and 'josh' means intense heat. The dish is an aromatic mutton curry which is cooked in oil on high flame. It is slightly different than the usual mutton curries because of the usage of some unique dry seasonings. Rogan josh can be prepared in two ways - one with onion and garlic, the other one is with yogurt and without onion, garlic. Kashmiri pandits cook this dish by following the second method. I also tried the 'no onion, no garlic' recipe and the taste came out phenomenal. The gravy may seems super spicy but actually it is mildly spicy. The authentic recipe calls for dry ginger (saut) powder and 'ratanjot' (for red colour), I didn't have those so I have used some grated ginger and kashmiri red chilli powder. Do try this delicious mutton rogan josh recipe in your kitchen and enjoy a good meal with your family.",

I will recommend you the second one for these stuffed tikkis as it enhances the taste of the entire dish. Now the ingredients of the stuffing are entirely up to you. I have used minced meat, but you can also use chicken, paneer, fish, lentils etc. Believe me, every time they will taste better and better. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy these delicious tikkis with coke or a glass of beer.",

I won't say that this is the authentic Arabian 'Maqlooba' because their cooking process and recipe are slightly different than ours. Anyway, I was searching for some new ideas and then found one. I was also impressed by its recipe, it's a one pot biriyani. You don't have to spend half of your day in kitchen making biriyani, the dish will take just an hour.

Generally in two ways you can make these fritters, one - you have to boil the florets before frying and two- you can stir fry them before deep frying like we Bengalis do.

As it was morning, we orderd veg like 'aloo paratha', 'aloo gobi', 'roti', 'bhindi masala' and 'lassi'. All of them were delicious but I will never forget the taste of 'aloo gobi'. Oh my god, my mouth is full of water right now !! It was the tasty, spicy and chatpata veg curry I have ever had. Bengalis usually make 'aloo-fulkopi' as a thick runny curry but that was a dry curry and goes best with roti and some salads. You can also give this yummy curry in lunchbox with bread. Try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turns out.",

They served a good amount of flavourful saffron rice, fresh spinach, some good falafel, tasty hummus and tzatziki sauce. We really loved everything in that bowl. But the sauce caught my main attention. It was so fresh, the flavours were unique and added a different taste to the whole bowl.

Then around 8 pm me and my papa used to decorate our roof with candles and after that we started doing fireworks with our family. Ohh, I almost forgot to tell you about food. My mom used to make various types of sweets at home and we enjoyed them a lot. So, I made 'baked rosogolla' for this diwali, my first attempt and I nailed it. Try this in your kitchen and share some of your diwali story with me.<br/><b>Spicy World wishes everyone a very Happy DiWaLi ...<\/b>",
